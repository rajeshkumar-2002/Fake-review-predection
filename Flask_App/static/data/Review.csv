1,Have to give it a 2 out of 5,"I love GG! This is a bootleg gone public. Lousy sound quality with extra noises and stuff from the BAD recorder. GG is close to flawless though, which is why it gets a two. On spin? No comment..."
1,Didn't last as long as an incandescent lightbulb,"As other reviewers experienced, this drive was superb in its performance, reading and writing anything which could be thrown at it. In this sense, the best burner I ever plugged into my system. Unfortunately, as other reviewers also experienced, its durability is simply inadequate, making it a poor value for its price. Mine lasted 4 days beyond the end of the warrantee period. To their credit, the company still honored the warrantee, but only after considerable difficulty communicating with them. Only a computer tech friend was able to contact them effectively in order to make the arrangements -- not adequate support. I was without the drive for nearly a month by the time all of this got done.SIMPLY NOT GOOD ENOUGH."
1,Great while it lasted,"I agreed with the other reviewers and would have given this drive 5 stars if I had written a review earlier. It installed perfectly and ran faultless and quietly, for the first two months. Then it stopped working and refused to recognise there was even a DVD in the drive. The breakdown was sudden. It wrote a DVD and then it stopped recognising any disks. I tried it in another machine with the same problem so it is the hardware.I wont pretend that my experience is typical but it may have something to do with the fact that this is a cheap drive and maybe you really do get what you pay for. I'm not trying to put you off this drive but if you do a lot of DVD writing then maybe a better drive might work longer."
1,Received Defective Item,"We've learn the lesson. When we received the package we didn't open the box and test it! By the time we open the box to use the catridge and found out that it is defective, the warranty already expired! So, the seller refused to exchange it for us."
1,Low Cost but Terrible Quality,"There is a stripe running down the middle of every page, the ink is inconsistent (leaves streaks, dark and light spots) and prints some material illegibly.Tried a second cartridge with the same results.Contacted seller and their response was:""Unfortunately the problem may be that you let the cartridges sit for too long, as they do have a shelf life. t this point there is not much assistance we can offer""I suggest that they send cartridges that sat on the shelf too long or they are just poor quality. I bought these in November and used them in March - a 4month shelf life, hmmm, that's not mentioned anywhere - in fact on end of the box there is a ""Use Before"" date that is blank.I'll never buy these again."
1,Review of Brother Black Toner (TN-350),Brother Black Toner Cartridge (TN-350)I ordered the Brother Black Toner TN-350 and received TN instead which does not fit in my printer! Reported this to Amazon - but have not had a response! Unhappy.
1,Do not ask me to review,Please do not ask me to review.I did not even get the product.I had to wait a month to file a complaint.Now I have to wait 2 weeks to get a response.This is utter nonsense.You took money out of my credit card.Shame on you for acting so slow.Kick that seller out of you site.The seller does not even respond.
1,Extremely Bad - Don't Buy This Book!!!,"I saw this author interviewed in a documentary about Edgar Cayce and I was intrigued enough to buy the book they referenced. Boy was I disappointed. There are hardly any direct quotes from Cayce and Thurston's interpretations are really ridiculous. Did you know that Atlantis didn't exist in the past and Cayce was confusing the past and the future, so his memories of Atlantis are actually predictions of a future civilization? Ideas like this and the fact that the book is really about Thurston's own ideas and not really about Cayce at all made me really angry that I wasted money on this thing."
1,"Does not deliver, in any way","This book does not live up to its title. No, I'm not a sceptic when it comes to prophecies, astrology or any other paranormal subject for that mather. But not a naive believer either.Therefore, reading this book, I couldn't help but finding myself being more and more desillusionated turning each page. The author hardly mentions any predictions. And when he does, he sticks to vague generalities.Certainly, Cayce explained that future events are largely dependent on human choice, therefore not set and outlined, but dynamic and can to some extend not be foreseen.Yet, I for one would at least have expected facts straight from the 14+ thousand predictions in the great Cayce archive. But you will not find any of that.So, if you want to read about Cayce's predictions, don't buy this book. It's a waste of your time and money."
1,A bit disappointing,"I should have known not to order a book that lacks the 'look inside' feature, but Ortho books are usually very good. This book was disappointing (to me, at least) for the following reasons: too basic, not enough information, and it does NOT include photograghs of the finished landscapes. Mostly I just do not like the illustrations--fuzzy chalk drawings that are hard on the eyes and lack definition. Selected ideas for building fences, pergolas, etc. consist of simple line drawings and no detailed instructions. Sorry Ortho, I've seen better."
1,Very few if any actual Cayce predictions,"This is an inspirational book a la Thurston. For me, the problem was that about 95% of the book is the author's words, with a very occasional quotation from Cayce. Also surprisingly, very little in the way of actual predictions for the 21st century. Not sure how the publisher arrived at the title for the book, perhaps to sell it?"
1,He has done better in the past,"I saw him do another stand up video where he talks about going into Harlem to visit his black girlfriend. That video was great, but this one was just average.I like it that he has an edgy style. But there are at least 2 times in this video where he sounds too angry or too annoyed.He definitely has the talent and creativity to be better and even be innovative. This video is not a good example of his talent."
1,Great but not durable,"I bought this DVD burner in Oct 05. It worked very well for the most part. Sometimes it had trouble reading DVDs and I had to open and reload several times, but when working, it worked great. Then in Oct 07 it stopped opening. I could hear it trying to get the drawer open, but it remained closed. I did not want to have to replace this after only 2 years, but I have no choice. I would not buy this item again nor would I recommend it to others."
1,FAulty product,"I've ordered, from Amazon, this product before as replacement cartridge for my Brother printer and never had a problem until this time. When I replaced the out-of-toner cartridge that was in my printer with this replacement cartridge the replacement failed in about three weeks time. My printer indicated it was out-of-toner. I removed the cartridge two times and shook it each time thinking that it would solve the problem. It did not. I telephone Brother and followed the representative's instructions and found that the security tape on the side of the cartridge had been ripped before I received it and was the cause of cartridge failure. I ordered another cartridge from Amazon to replace that one and installed it in my machine. Hopefully it will not fail me as the security tape on the side of the new one was intact."
1,"On-Stage Microphone 13-inch Gooseneck, Black","This gooseneck, after having been flexed a mere handful of times, began to break: inferior quality! The whole point of a gooseneck attachment is that you can bend it, and this one did not like to bend."
1,Far Too flexible for use with a professional microphone,I purchased 2 of these items to use with my band for the guitarists. I was disapointed when I mounted a Shure sm 58 mic on it and found that the goose neck would not stay erect. These are made far too loose and flexible for most professional mics. They may work on very small and light weight units but for my needs they are totally unuseable. It would have been helpful to include the suggested weight that this goose neck would support in the sales description. I wasted my money. Don't waste yours. Perhaps viagra would be helpful ;-)
1,Flimsy but I made it work,This gooseneck is pretty flimsy. I ended up filling it with epoxy in the shape that I wanted it. Now it will hold anything.It gets the job done though and the price was right.
1,They are ok,"Soft and pretty sheets, even though they are not queen size, they run smaller and more after first wash, something that never happened with any other sheets I've bought so far. The color gets lighter in time. They are ok."
1,"Very different, but interesting.","This was a strange and confusing book. It's about Frank Yerby, he is on his deathbed, and really unhappy about it. He's a writer who's books don't have readers, and the characters of his books aren't happy about that either. I thought was a really odd book.The book did wander, and even though I understood the basic message I just couldn't really understand it all. Maybe it is for greater minds than mind I don't know."
1,Confusing,"This is the second novel I have read from this author and while I enjoyed the first one, this one simply confused me. Stovall takes a look at one of his favorite subject matters - the role of black people in society and in particular, in this novel, their victimization - through the eyes of a ""somewhat"" forgotten novelist - Yerby who has been on record as saying that black people are responsible for their lot in life.Yet, at the same time, they are asking Yerby to recant his words or they may never exist again.I found this book highly confusing to read and although I got the basic message coming out of the storyline, it felt as though the role of Yerby was overextended greatly.I am still scratching my head on this one."
1,The least accessible of all Residents recordings,"The Big Bubble has an intersting, if not original, concept: a musical group makes recordings in their native language in defiance of the law, and become a hit. Is this a dream the Residents have for themselves? This is a part of the entire Mole legend that the Residents dreamed up, and have used in four previous recordings (Mark of the Mole, The Mole Show Live, The Tale of Two Cities, Intermission) However, as a whole, the Big Bubble is not a success. Using some of the most unlistenable singing the Residents ever released, and some of the most unlistenable music. I say this from the angle of a long-time (since 1978) Residents fan.There are some interesting cuts, especially Cry for Fire (which can be best described as bad sex followed by an incredible orgasm) but get this only if you are a die hard - gotta have it all fan."
1,Terrible.. One of the worst albums ever in history,"I bought this album when it first came out on vinyl. When I got it home, I was gravely dissapointed. I had been enthralled with The Residents up to that time, and absolutley loved The Mark Of The Mole and Intermission. This album came out and I was expecting the Mole Story to be further advanced, and all I got was just a bunch of wordless moaning and groaning and gibberish that sounded like it was coming from an person suffering from autism along side of some of the worst song lyrics of all time. I immediatley sold it back to the store."
1,Live,"I bought this album thinking it was a greatest hits compilation. I was wrong. It's a LIVE ALBUM. I have not listened to any more than what it took to hear the applause in the beginning of all the tracks, so I can't vouch for the quality of the recording itself. But if you are looking for the original hits, don't buy this import! Sedaka fans might want it for their collection, I don't know, someone else might want to write a review of the quality of the performance. But if all you want are the original recordings of the latter part of Sedaka's career, look elsewhere. You will not find them here."
1,New formula is not better than before.,"I've been using Ciment Anti-Usure for five or six years now. I have fine, thin hair and it was the perfect conditioner for me. It made my hair soft and manageable with no flyaway static problems, even in the dead of winter. I just started using my first bottle of the new formula about a month ago, and I am not a fan. My hair looks limp and greasy, yet I have so much static going on my bangs constantly stick to my face. My natural wave is hardly noticeable with the new formula."
1,Sedaka Sings Elevator Music,"Listening to this, I truly realized that Sedaka made his greatest contributions to pop music in the '50's and '60's. Aside from the few hits (Laughter in the Rain, Bad Blood, Lonely Nights, etc.) he produced in the '70's, Sedaka's M.O.R. ""Second career"" mainly produced songs for the Geritol set. Buy yourself a good early Sedaka compilation (Sings the Hits comes to mind) and give this one to your grandparents."
1,Do not bother. Cannot hold the weight. Flimsy!,"This product is terrible. It cannot hold the weight of any microphone over 1 lb, and I would question that, based on your angle of use. It is terribly made with flimsy construction and I do not recommend its purchase. Look for a more sturdy built construction gooseneck mic holder. They are out there, it's just not this one. Fortunately Amazon was great about their return policy, which I appreciate. Thank you Amazon for at least having a positive return experience."
1,Received a refurbished cartridge,"When I bought the Brother TN350 Black Toner Cartridge, I was under the impression that I was getting a new cartidge (probably due to the picture), but received a refurbished cartridge. Other than that, the price and delivery were good."
1,Disapointment Pirate Ship,"Well I too am disappointed in this purchase. I bought this for my son's 4th Birthday and I have been putting it together ever since! The pieces fall off, nothing stays where it should. I understand the concept of building and rebuilding but it should be because you want to not because it keeps falling apart. I am seriously thinking of super gluing all if the pieces together (except the pirates). I can't believe that Fisher Price would make something so flimsy that you can't play with it."
1,Poor Quality,I would suggest paying a little more and getting a better quality toner cartridge. Since installing it I have been getting black spots and specs of toner all over my printouts and copies. I would not purchase these again.
1,Too terse and academic,"This book tries to cover far too much in too little space, much of which is taken up by examples that are not that great and lack any type of highlighting, arrows, boxes, etc. that would help you quickly find the relevant pieces.Regardless of whether the author had a page limit or simply favors a terse and academic style, the net result was that I had to seek other sources to understand numerous points, and they universally explained the topic much more logically and in an easy to follow and, more importantly, read fashion.All in all a very painful read."
1,Semi-techie's evaluation,"This book tells you what you need to know. However, it is a bit of a hard slog because it doesn't tell you why you need to know it. It also throws in obscure acronyms and not only expects you to know what they stand for, but what those protocols/standards/programs imply. Yes, you can learn all you need to know about SQL schema, (and more than you need to know - without telling you why you need to know it, you don't know what to skip), but it is a little more painful than it has to be."
1,Sloppy editing an embarrassment for O'Reilly,"This book appears to have been thrown together overnight, without the attention of a proofreader or content editor. While I can't say it's actually missing important content, it is certainly the sloppiest O'Reilly book I've ever read. The very first example (on p. 6) is a glaringly ill-formed XML document (the second line contains spurious junk text, as if from a word-processing error), and it just continues from there. The book contains numerous apparent ""cut-and-paste"" errors of this kind, as well as evidence that global search-and-replace operations were hastily performed on the entire text without subsequent proofreading. What's up, O'Reilly?"
1,An Editing Nightmare,"This book had potential to be a definitive guide to XML schema. This is not the kind of book you can pick up and read cover to cover (unless insomnia is a real condition for you, in which case this book may help). It is, by no means, a tutorial of XML schema - or even a reference. It's more of an exploratory academic walk of the W3C recommendation and all of its foibles and nuances. There is wealth of information in this book, if you can glean it out from inbetween the droning prose and historical diatribe.O'Reilly should be shamefully embarassed for ever letting this book go to print in the condition it is. It is replete with errata, typos, and slopped together examples. This book is destined to frustrate those new to XML schema. An uncharacteristicly poor level of quality for O'Reilly."
1,Doesn't Work,I'm sorry I wasted money on this. It didn't even slightly work. It just made my glasses kind of greasy with black streaks before it was completely wiped away.
1,Didnt work,"This item does not come with a buffing cloth, and did nothing for the light scratches on my eyeglasses or sunglasses."
1,Not quite as expected,"I ordered a remanufactured Brother TN350 Black Toner Cartridge. A cartridge arrived quickly and works in the printer.HOWEVER, the cartridge which arrived was not a remanufactured Brother cartridge, but rather a third-party cartridge. I specifically chose this item because it was a Brother cartridge, not a third-party cartridge.Since the cartridge is for my daughter in college, we do not have time to hassle with this issue, so for pragmatic reasons I have accepted the cartridge. However, the advertisements and picture are not correct."
1,Best of Dick and Dee Dee,I was not impressed with the sound quality of this CD. I did not think that it sounded like the original. I would not recommend this product.
1,"I did not want to, but I did read it.","The review title says it all. I believe for one to get an accurate perspective, one must read both sides. Anyone living through the Vietnam Era and serving in the military through this would truly like to burn this book.Those that were on the ""peace"" side need to be thanked. Thank them for aiding a people killing 58,000 American soldiers, thank them for helping kill 4.5 million Laotians, Cambodians and Vietnamese. It was there peace movement that forced the politicans to abandon these people and leave them to be slaughtered by the enemy they aided.The activists and supporters of the peace movements have the blood of these millions on their hands. This book needs to read by all those that want to know and understand the peace movements of that day and this day are nothing more than appeasements to those wishing to destroy the freedoms so many have died for.This book is trash."
1,ali wants nelly's spot bad,ali never had a serious fanbase cept for being affiliated with nelly so if you';re a serious goodie mob or gipp fan pick it up ugk pops up on here troo so get it only for that too bad st. louis rappers are'nt getting much play I'd rather spend my money on murphy lee's project.
1,Not as advertised,The item I received was NOT CORRECT. Wrong picture posted!!! I couldn't use the product.
1,Not worth the money,My 5 year old BEGGED for this toy for Christmas. He has only played with it maybe 3 times in 4 months. It comes apart too easily and my 5 year old can't put it back together himself.
1,A very poorly written book,"The ""Author's Note"" irritated me (check out the first and last sentences) and the first paragraph of the book irritated me even more. This goes beyond writing style or inventive wordplay ala Riddley Walker or Feersum Endjinn - Foy seems oblivious to the basic rules of grammar. After reading the first page I flipped through at random and it didn't get any better. This book got thrown across the room, then picked up and put in the bin. However judging by some of the other write-ups it contains some very good ideas. So read the first page - if this doesn't bug the **** out of you maybe you'll enjoy it."
1,"Written for the academic world, not the business world","I'd advise that this one be avoided if you're looking for practical methods of actually managing design alliances. The entire book is really just an exhaustive definition of the concept of design alliances, with detailed descriptions of the various types that exist. No real practical information for the manager or executive looking for help with any one particular situation."
1,More appropriate for 6yrs & up...,"My son received the Imaginext ship for his 4th birthday. He's a dextrous little guy, but this ship does not stay together despite help from an adult. The ship and accessory components are packaged in sections and must be assembled. Much of the assembly was easy enough for a child to do but, the toy wasn't fun because the sections of ship so not stay together when playing with the ""finished"" item. The masts fall off, and the main peices of the ship separate when you don't want them to. My son was so discouraged he asked if we could return it for a toy that ""works right"". We bought Black Beard's Pirate Ship by Play Mobil and my son is very happy with that toy. He needed more adult help with the assembly, but it stayed together once it was assembled and now he's having lots of fun playing with it."
1,wouldn't buy this ship for kids younger then 6,my son got the pirate ship for a gift and he is 4 years old. he got so frustrated with it because all of the pieces kept folling off. the mast wouldn't stay up for anything! and the nets to the mast would not fit. I don't know what fisherprice is thinking with this toy line but this one was horrible.
1,Don't Order This!,"This ships without the Curriculum Starter Cards. I ordered and received an 11 page guide to using the Starter Cards. I was told by the customer service rep at Amazon that they were sorry I misunderstood the contents. They advised me to return the item, which I did. I am trying to save anyone else the frustration of getting a guide to using nonexistent cards for $40."
1,never received book,I've been in contact with the book supplier and have waited now for a month for the book. Each time i write them they tell me to write back in a week.Very disappointed to not have this gift to put under the tree.
1,Terrible toy,"I can remember when Fisher-Price toys were a whole lot friendlier...all the characters have weapons and ""fierce"" expressions. A friend of mine bought this for her three yr old daughter because she saw the box and begged, then after it was opened, the girl refused to play with the ""mean people"". The concept is good, but why does it have to be so violently oriented?"
1,Falls Apart Constantly,"My three-year-old boy loves pirates, so I was thrilled to get him this ship. Unfortunately, the ship took me a while to assemble, and comes apart instantly. The three pieces of the boat separate constantly, the rigging and railing pops right off, and the masts regularly fall over. There are a lot of small pieces, which are OK for him, but could be a problem for other young children. He still likes the boat, but playing with it requires a fair amount of adult assistance as it is constantly falling apart. I personally wouldn't even purchase it for an older child, but maybe you would be OK in the over seven-age group."
1,Not OEM genuine Brother TN350 Cartridges,The title on the description and the picture leads you to believe that this is an OEM genuine product but it appears to be a remanufactured product when it arrived. Do not buy if you want orignial OEM Brother TN-350.
1,Toner Purchase,I did not receive what I ordered. I ordered Brother toner and got generic recycled toner cartridge. Will never purchase from this company again.
1,Buyer Beware,"Printer says ""No toner cartridge"" when it is installed. The old cartridge works just fine except that it is out of toner so I KNOW it is the cartridge. Because the sticker got scraped off by me putting it in the machine so many times and trying to get it to work, Brother will not accept the return. I feel totally ripped off.....$44 for NOTHING! I think I'll just buy a different brand printer!!!"
1,Falls Apart Constantly,"This item is horrible. It falls apart constantly. We tried hot gluing and superglue, however, NOTHING works. Even our 4-1/2 YR son has told us to throw this out he is so frustrated.Part of appeal was you can take Imaginext items & reconfigure them, great concept. However, no matter how you configure them, they ALL fall apart.During assembly notice they do not ""click"" as you would expect. Pieces never lock together, even with the bottom ""base"" pieces.We resorted to putting all the Imaginext on a table for him to play, however, flat surface, bumpy surface, any surface, it falls apart.(...)When a 4-1/2 YR wants you to throw out his toys, somethings wrong!"
1,SOUTHWORTHBOOKS AND THINGS,"I ordered this book two weeks ago from southworth books and things and along with this book i ordered a couple other books and a new canning kit, i have received everything but this book, I was excited to get this book since I read a lot of home and garden publications but everyone keeps telling me to wait a couple more weeks and see if i get it, I am starting to get frustrated and south worth books said it would have gotten mailed out two days after i ordered it, that means it has been in limbo for almost a full two weeks and nothing is being done about it. If you plan on ordering this book or any other do not order from south worth books and things"
1,Tough and Boring,"He's got a lot to say, but I didn't find it at all inspiring. I guess if I had a coach the helped me practice these principles it would work. But it's tough and boring to learn from a book."
1,Brother Drum,"Ordered Brother Drum and the drum was defective. Printer indicated ""dust on drum"" and would not function. Would not work in any other printers in the office that use the same type drum. Had to return drum, have not received replacement yet. Unable to use machine. Hope next drum is not defective."
1,CARTRIDGE DOESN'T WORK WITH A BROTHER MFC-7220,"Don't order this ""generic"" less expensive cartridge as a replacement for a Brother MFC-7220 (multi-function printer/copier/fax)cartridge. Worked OK for a few days but copies were very smudgy with black outline on edges. After a few days, repeatedly received a ""drum error message"" and with resultant printer jams. Finally gave up trying to print with this less expensive cartridge and ordered the Brother brand cartridge, which works fine."
1,box was resealed and the foil bag was torn open,"Ships from and sold by listing showed on this itembut when I received the item , it was from a closeout storethe box was resealed and the foil bag was torn open.appeared to be possibly used."
1,Not for fans of TR,"As an admirer of Theodore Roosevelt, I was very disappointed in Mr. Brands' book. It appeared to me that Mr. Brands' intent was to analyze the life of this great man strictly from his critic's point of view. While any good biography worth its salt should present a balanced view of the man, Mr. Brands appears to go out of his way to find fault in almost all of TR's actions. TR was by no means a perfect man, however, history has proven him to be one of our greatest presidents. One gets the sense after reading this dreadfully long and depressing account of TR that Mr. Brands'truly disliked his subject."
1,Too expensive and lasts only two weeks. VERY DISAPPOINTING,"VERY DISAPPOINTING!!!Ink was empty VERY fast. I was only able to print about 250-300 pages. Horrible! I didn't expect it's going to end so fast and now only after several weeks I'm stuck with ""Change Toner"""
1,Poor Quality,"The donor roll (the rubber roll you see with the toner on it) had a ding in it which resulted in a large dot every inch or so all the way down every page printed.I poured the toner out of the new cartridge and into the old one.New or refurbished, I was ripped off."
1,Amazon selling knockoff as Brother TN-350,"I decided to spend a little extra money to buy directly from Amazon -- not from one of the stores that sells through Amazon -- to make sure that I was actually buying a REAL Brother toner cartridge. Sadly, Amazon sent me a knockoff refurbished cartridge that didn't even make it to 2000 copies. Don't let Amazon's picture of the Brother TN-350 box fool you, they may send you a knockoff."
1,Defective unit,"It's above 40 degrees outside, so the heater base shouldn't even be on, but the hen's water was so hot it was steaming. It wasn't just the water in the lower lip that they drink from, but when I opened the water container, all of the water was approx the temp of a hot bath. I don't know if the hens have been drinking it, but it would be uncomfortably hot for a human. I will attempt to return the heater and hope that a replacement will not do this, but if you go for this unit, check the water often to make sure that it's shutting off when it's supposed to."
1,lasted only 4 months,"This worked very well for us for about 4 months, then it just stopped heating. We made it just to the end of our winter months, but I certainly expected to use this for more than one season. Disappointing. I'm back on Amazon today, looking for a replacement."
1,Refurbished Cartridge sold as new!!!,"This was supposed to be a NEW cartridge, but I actually received a refurbished unit inside of what looked to be an original, brand new packaging. The product arrived in its original ""Brother"" box, in a properly sealed vacuum package, and the box even has a ""genuine Brother"" hologram. However, once I removed the cartridge from the original packaging I immediately realized that it was obviously a refurbished unit. The cartridge itself was all dirty with toner, it had finger prints all over, the screws looked like they had been tampered with, and a new ""warranty seal"" had been placed on top of the original warranty seal. This was definitely a refurbished cartridge, sold in a new packaging and made to look like a new one!!! If you buy it, make sure you check it once you receive it."
1,Adaptador de ipod para jvc,"Me parece que el adapatador para el ipod es muy malo ya que la forma como controlas el ipod con el reproductor es demasiado incomodo, ya que yo he tenido otras pantallas que manejan ipod y esta es la peor, aunque el repro en si no es malo"
1,"Worse, Purchase","I don't like this product and also the company I purchase this from will never take back right after I send then 2email, one before I purchase this item, and the other after they send it, I will never used Amazon to purchase anything else, or partner, Worse company I have done use"
1,Save your money!,"I was hoping that this would be a great compilation CD, but I could barely even listen to it! There is nothing in the description that reveals that the songs on this album were recorded live and it is, quite possibly, one of the most poorly produced albums I've ever heard! Voices and instruments drown each other out in jumps and spurts and I couldn't even recognize some of these classic songs. Do yourself a favor - stay away from his album!"
1,Horrible! Didn't even get 300 pages.,"Super low quality product. Poor print quality.Cartridge was only partially filled (printed less than 300 pages, should print upwards of 2000).Customer service was rude and less than helpful."
1,musical self-destruction,"This is the worst CD I've ever heard - it's painful to see how the band apparently systematically destroys the structure of these originally beautiful songs. (The vocals are horrifying) Sure, this CD has all the big Jefferson tunes on it - but do yourself a favor and don't be fooled into buying this cause it's so cheap. I actually suspect this is some kind of bootleg of a live concert. This CD should never have been produced"
1,Should have just gotten a cd changer,I thought it would be a good idea to be able to run a wire to my glove compartment leave my old ipod video in there then who ever was in my passenger seat could change the song. However there is no way of setting it so you can use the ipod interface much easier to just plug my iPhone into the front.Comes with a lot of unnecessary wiring too. takes up alot of room. really hard to fit between my bluetooth adapter and my cigarette lighter since that was the only place it could go.
1,Worst. Interface. Ever.,"Does not work with iPhone or Touch, as many have noted.Used with the iPod models it DOES work with, you will encounter one of the worst user interfaces in the history of consumer electronics. Absolutely no sorting or organization features for music of any kind - no folders, no playlists, no sorting by artist or album. You get an alphabetical list of tracks on your device. Just start with ""A"" and, if you have more than 20 songs on your iPod, settle in for a few hours of scrolling through song titles to get to anything that starts with ""The."""
1,Does not work with ipod Touch or Iphone,I bought this item not knowing what I know now. This adapter does not work with Ipod Touch or Iphone. You can google this adapter and will find the same information.
1,Disapointed,I was assured by the seller that this product would work with my radio -- not so. I need to contact and return
1,Waste of time,"For the JVC receiver I got it is a waste of time and money. My receiver already got an USB conector and it is much easier to operate the Ipod using the USB conection than using this adaptor. I expected that the operations should more similar to operating the Ipod itseft, but it is a big mess. I finaly gave up and now I only hook up my Ipod inthe USB connector of the receiver."
1,Doesn't work properly with IPod Video and JVC KD-HDR1,I bought this device expecting full controlling my IPod Video via JVC KD-HDR1 head unit but after installation got only charging and sound transfer from IPod to head unit. VERY disappointed but at list I can listen music.
1,DECEPTIVE MARKETING,"The title of this is deceptive marketing. It should be a crime to mislabel an album like this.These are not ""extended"" versions by any means, but simply badly recorded live versions. The only ""extension"" is the addition of alot - did I mention ""alot""? - of audience noise. A complete waste.Buy the individual albums or Greatest Hits instead."
1,"Connects the iPod to my car stereo, lacks usability","The reason i bought this product was because i was hoping to make driving safer. It's good to have the controls for the iPod on the stereo instead of looking for the iPod and then looking for a particular song.This product just made my driving more dangerous. The menu system on this is slow, it does not remember where you are browsing so everytime you have to start browsing right from the beginning, and this would be single biggest issue with this product. If it just remembered where i am in the menu.Don't get this if you think it will make your life easier while driving."
1,Do not purchase if you have an IPOD Touch,I bought this for use with my Ipod Touch and it doesn't recognize the ipod at all - it is useless for me......
1,Very disappointed!,"No drills? Very little instruction! I was very disappointed. I have heard good things about TI, but I just wasted my money on this dvd. I can not believe I paid good money for this video!!! It was like watching a very long commercial. Total waste of time and money. If it was free I would not watch it. This is my first negative review. I just had to worn other people!."
1,"If it streaks, you're out of luck","I always buy only the manufacturer's toner to make sure it's high quality, and I always keep a couple in stock. The last one streaked. I called Brother and went through the company's troubleshooting process by phone, and the service tech concluded that there was indeed a problem with the cartridge, but because I had purchased it 3 months ago, they would not replace it. I offered to send them the cartridge so they could make sure it was a brand new toner cartridge. The tech said no. If we all do business only with those companies that use fairness and common sense; we will create a better world."
1,Not happy with it.,"Non-intuitive navigation. You have to start at ""A"" every time you select from top level play list or ""artist"", ""Album"" , ""Genre"" etc.Also after finally find what album/artist you wish to play and start to preview the tracks; All the sudden the word ""stop"" comes up on the LCD display and you can not go anywhere, no previous,next track etc can be accessed anymore. Then you have to start all the way from the top and go through all the A's,B's,C's and so on. It is a pain in the butt!If your head unit accepts AUX input via 1/8, connect your Ipod that way. You will be able to navigate much faster that way and avoid the stupid ""stop"" message.I gave it two stars because it does actually interface with the I-pod to some degree. That where it stops."
1,"If you want a giant mess on your hands, this is perfect","Decided to replace working generic (but fading) cartridge with an official TN-350 Brother cartridge for my beloved Brother laser printer. There was some toner loose in the cartridge bag, which I took as a bad sign, but I HAD to print out postage for a customer package this morning.Big mistake - after I followed their directions to replace the cartridge and tried to print, nothing happened. I opened up the printer to find that toner had POURED out all over the inside of the printer, the table, the floor, the sheaf of expensive paper inside. It'll cost hours that I don't have to clean it all out, if if even can be cleaned completely. The paper is ruined regardless. My customer is going to be very unhappy about the delay.Manufaturing defects are completely unacceptable for any cartridge, much less an expensive one like this.Lesson learned: Buy generic. At the very least, it can't be any worse, and may be much better."
1,Web attack,How to start? Prologue to long. Not enough dialogue. Too many points of view and an ending that falls on its face
1,Very unhappy with this book,"It did not flow at all. The violence was crude, the characters were not developed at all. I could not get through more than 40%, which was a real push. I tried to skip ahead just to follow the plot lines, and was unable to continue."
1,Cost me a once in a lifetime trip to Rome!,"I purchased my new SanDisk Ultra II 256 MB CF card in April for a trip to Italy in May. I filled the card up with pictures (Canon Elf) and all seemed well. I was able to review the pictures on the camera while in Rome fine. When I returned to the States, the CF card was unreadable by any computer. Even a Data Recovery company said it was corrupted beyond recovery. I seem to have lost about 80 pictures of a once in a lifetime trip to Rome Italy. Thanks Sandisk."
1,Fast Card,"I have a Canon G5. When compared to a standard Kingston and SimpleTech CF card, the Sandisk Ultra II seems to operaate up to 60% faster when taking new pictures or browsing existing pictures on the card. As far as transfer rates to the PC, I don't see any difference in performance using a USB1.1 interface, either directly from the camera or from a USB card reader. This card operates fast between shots and is worth the premium if you have a fast camera that can take advantage of its speed. One of the newer SLR digitals would be a great pairing with this card. Great product."
1,Received it opened and unsealed,"I was very disappointed to see that the box was unsealed, the toner (normally sealed) bag was open and the toner cartridge looked used. The installation instructions were missing. It felt like this was a returned product that was passed off. Very, very annoying."
1,Card conked off after a year of use.,A sandisk card that I'd purchased conked after one year of use. I don't think its worth buying a cheap product that's going to last only a year. I'd rather buy a expensive brand thats going to last me at least 3-4 years.
1,Worst Weber I have read,I can't wait until a new novel by David Weber comes out. I was extremely disappointed in this work. I had read the original and had found it mediocre. This added nothing but alot of words. There is little plot and no character development beyond the main character. I am glad I didn't buy this one. Probably only one I don't own.
1,Weak. Very weak.,"I've been a fan of David Weber for years; in fact, Mutineer's Moon and its sequels is still one of my favorite series. The first 4 or 5 Harrington books rocked, and I lovedPath of the Fury.But I've noticed a trend with Weber in the last few years - the last few Harrington books got so bogged down with political and technical claptrap that the story disappeared. It's very disappointing, because Weber used to be able to tell a darn good story.In Fury Born has followed the precedent; I couldn't get past the first 100 pages because of all the other stuff getting in the way. Which is too bad, because I always wanted to know DeVries' backstory."
1,don't waste your money,"I bought 3!Ok, yeah they are fun till they break. The rotor's broke, so instructed me to use TAPE if this should happen. Still messed up!! I tried to find replacement rotors.... Oh yeah, I got em all right, but the rotors were set OPPOSITE than the original rotors for the helicopter. So instead of flying UP, it goes nowhere!! I still have not been able to find the CORRECT rotors!! I am open to any suggestions if you can find them!"
1,"Yes, you are a loser","This album strikes me as interesting, although very bad. The 1990's was a unique time in Rock in that it allowed bands to talk badly about themselves, but somehow still remain cool. You never felt that they were actual losers, even though the lyrics declared it. I remember listening to ""creep"" by Radiohead and thinking that it was the first time I ever felt that a lead singer was sincerely down on himself - the sincerity of the self-defeating song was what made it forgivable, cool even. This Grand Mal CD is not forgivable. The entire CD is full of self-defeated expressions that come off as loser-ish. You can't declare that you've been beaten unless you've truly put forth extreme effort - so that at least you have a little beauty amidst your defeat - This CD is so half assed that when it comes time for the confession of self-defeat, coolness is not pulled off - but pathetic is."
1,Failed after 2 weeks,"After only 2 weeks of usage my prints were light as if the toner was low. Turned printer off and took toner out and examined, it seemed fine and put it back in. Just 2 days later the same thing started happening again. I am running my own business and I did not have time to reorder and wait days for arrival, I needed a cartridge immediately to replace. I had to go to local office supply and purchase a new cartridge. Upon installing the new cartridge from local office supply, I now have no problems with my prints or the printer."
1,Must Leave Power On to Save Images,"I've known and happily used SanDisk CF cards before, high quality, good price. This Ultra II card comes with some worries. Since CF doesn't write at 9MB/sec, it uses a ""buffer"" to write a small amount (like 4 megs) to an ultra-fast buffer, then the image is slowly transferred to the main card. And there's the problem.I lost every ""last image"" on my trip to Italy. When I powered on the camera, took say 5 pictures, it would record 4 and lose the last image. This is because I was turning the camera off after taking the 5th picture. I needed to leave the camera on another 20 seconds to be sure the memory card finished transfer of the images. So it's very fast, for a small burst of pictures, but LEAVE THE CAMERA ON. I did a lot of ""that's cool!"" pictures... you turn the camera on, take a picture, turn the camera off to save battery life. Mistake. Make sure you REVIEW the images (and not just the temporary image displayed after the picture is taken) before POWERING DOWN."
1,Not What's Pictured,"I can't comment on the quality of the ink cartridge that we received from Shoplet because it is our office policy not to insert Non-Genuine parts into our equipment. The photo and everything described in this listing indicates that they are offering a GENUINE Brother TN-350 cartridge. I should have known something was ""off"" from the extremely low price. I don't understand how Shoplet can use the Brother photo to represent their off-brand product! Must give Shoplet credit for quick response when we complained- they arranged a prepaid FEDEX pickup the very next day and refunded all our money including shipping."
1,Beware: This CD re-issue is copy protected,"I'm sure this version of ""Two for the Show"" is superb. However, I can't tell because this re-issue is copy protected and cannot be ripped to MP3. All the songs skip, like any CD that uses the insidious ""Copy Control Technology"". This especially sucks for people like me who listen to all their music on an iPod - at home, in the car and walking around.The Compact Disc logo is not anywhere on these discs or the packaging. Discs that do not follow the rules are not allowed to display the logo. This means that such discs will not play on a computer, or many types of modern players.It's a shame record companies insist on alienating those of us who actually buy CDs. I'm returning these coasters as defective. In the future, if it doesn't have the Compact Disc logo on it, I'm not buying."
1,Not worth the cost!,This lasted two months of 30 degree temps. Came out one morning and the whole waterer was frozen solid! For $50 it should last longer than a couple months. Very disappointed.
1,not the full album,"All these great CD reviews... But this CD is not the complete ""Two For The Show"" that was a 2-LP vinyl record set back in the day. So, you're missing some stuff, like ""Closet Chronicles,"" and it's not even remastered from original tapes (sounds all hissy), and still gets your blood going, eh? If KANSAS is reading this, please oh please do a Little-Feat-""Waiting For Columbus""-style remaster on this great live album and INCLUDE THE COMPLETE SHOW! Otherwise, I'd wait to buy it."
1,Received third-party (not OEM) cartridge on last order,"I've been purchasing these cartridges from Amazon for years and have found them to offer the best combination of cost, convenience and speed. With my Prime membership, it has been great to be able to order and receive a new cartridge in 2 days.I was very surprised and disappointed on my last order to open the box and find a third-party ""equivalent"" toner cartridge. Had this change been disclosed on Amazon's site, I would not have placed this order. And...the price was higher than they used to charge for OEM cartridges! Many people of course buy third-party cartridges - but only if they are lower in price than the OEM. This change really seems like ""bait and switch"" to me and is very contrary to Amazon's generally excellent business practices.The non-OEM product arrived in the Brother box and was sold and shipped by Amazon.com not by a third-party seller."
1,So far out-of-date as to be worthless,"The cutting edge of technology for this book is Visual Studio 6.0! And the author's language of choice is Visual Fox Pro!The copyright date for this book is 2001. How about an update? Take the .NET technology into account. Work with VB.NET or C#.And ""Essential""? What I was hoping to learn was the ins and outs of creating and maintaining different threads of a project -- production, debugging, development. This book was no help there."
1,Totally disappointing!!!!!,"This book looks more like the online help. I am totally disappointed with this book. Unfourtunately I cannot return it because I got the ebook. I should have heeded to one of the reviews on this site about this book and not bought it. The MSDN resources give you a better understanding of how to use sourcesafe more effectively in a complex environment. This book lacks information on complex topics like sharing, branching, pinning and how to effectively use them. If you are looking for a printed version of the online help organised and worded bit differently then this book is for you, otherwise please stay away!!!"
1,Does it print less than it used to?,"I love my 4350 imageclass, just like I loved the 4100. I am a very high-volume printer for my law office, where we have 2 of these. It seems like the Canon 104 Toner cartridges used to last a lot, lot longer. Is it my imagination or in the past several months do they print less and less? What a racket. We are going to have to ditch both of these printers. We've had them for years, and if anything the volume we put out of them has gone down, yet we are changing the cartridges every couple of weeks where it used to be every couple of months - I truly believe something has changed with the 104's. Am I off base?"
1,NOT GENUINE,Be careful. You are not purchasing a genuine canon cartridge. They are falsely advertising this cartridge.
1,Item was not remanufactured by the Original Manufacturer,"Toner smeared all over my paper when printed, do not buy from this place. It was not even remanufactured by Brother but rather just a refill by a third party with the original cartridge. What a scam?"
1,Didn't like this book.,"I got this book because we loved Baby Beluga so much, so I wanted to try another Raffi book. But I didn't like this one at all. The song was so plain and hard to sing to, and didn't really line up with the pages well. My son was bored by it immediately. And there really wasn't a story to follow along to."
1,Does Not Fit Brother HL-2040,Ordered this for my Brother HL-2040. It was about half the size needed to fit the printer. Try other sources.
1,cartridge not filled with enough toner,"I received my TN-350 in December, 2011. I am shocked to be receiving ""out of toner"" warnings from my printer after only 4 months. I have to take the cartridge out for each page and shake it to get my page to print. My last Brother laser toner cartridge lasted me 5 years. This was a refurbished cartridge and it seems that it wasn't filled properly or I've been scammed. Either way I am very disappointed in this product's performance."
1,Good for Some but Not for Us,"This book had lots of good reviews. I'm thinking this is because the owners were already familiar with the song. If you are particular about your children's books, because you'll be reading them over and over, read them first at the library or bookstore to make sure you like them before buying."
1,bad book,It was creepy. I only read a small part of it and stopped. If it was a paperback I would throw it away.
1,I need response from the seller..,"I decided to spend a little extra money to buy a manufactured Brother Tn-350 Toner and wish that I won't get a refurbished product or a defective one. I received the item on time. I didn't, however, opened it when I received it. I was trying to use up my old toner. Two weeks later, I opened the toner I purchased and found the toner is faulty...making strange noise and printing unwanted stripes...I sent email to the seller--Databazaar and haven't got any reply yet. I can only return the toner to Databazaar without notifying them since the return policy said a return must be made 30 days within invoice date.Now, school just starts and I can't print anything since my old toner is used up and my new toner is on its way back to the seller. And the worst part is that nobody seems care about it. I'm worried that I may end up spending $45.19 and getting nothing...."
1,not what I liked,This book didn't have any ideas I could really use because the bathrooms were very large and not what a normal average home would have. This book is over rated and I don't recommend it.
1,TN350 doesn't work in the Brother HL-5250DN,"The HL-5250DN is a fine printer, but if you purchase it, don't purchase a TN350 cartridge as I did, relying on the Amazon representation that it will work. You'll find that the TN350 will not mate with the drum unit TN550 cartridge combo that comes in the printer. Maybe you can spring for a different drum unit (think another $80) and get that combo to work; I don't know. But the TN350 cartridge categorically won't work in a new HL-5250DN, unless you want to try your hand with a hacksaw. And the TN350 isn't heavy enough to make a good door stop.To be fair, Amazon isn't alone in representing that the TN350 will work. The Brother user manual specifies the TN550 or TN580 (high capacity)."
1,Did Danielle really write this?,"My recollections: sparkly clothes, an alcholic bionic man, and tons and tons of pre-marital sex. I had to check the cover several times to see if Danielle was truly the author. I concede ... it had me laughing out loud several times, and I kinda wished I had a boyfriend like the outgoing, sparkly clone."
1,Clones It's Just Clones of all things to write about!!!!!,"The only thing Il iked about this book was that it was short, making it less painful to finish reading."
1,Worst Yet,"Danielle, How could you???. I struggled through ""HIS Bright LIGHT"", thinking it had to get better, now ""THE KLONE AND I"" is even worse, which seems impossible!!. Save your money and boycott this horrific book! and the boring, wimpy characters."
1,DON'T EVEN DARE TO READ THIS BOOK,"NEVER BEFORE HAVE I READ SUCH HORRIBLE REVIEWS OF ANY BOOK. LIKE THE MAJORITY OF THESE READERS, I TOO LIKE STEEL'S BOOKS AND HAVE READ MOST OF THEM, BUT JUDGING BY THESE REVIEWS OF THIS LATEST BOOK AM SCARED TO DEATH TO EVER BUY ANOTHER BOOK BY STEEL."
1,Don't even waste YOUR TIME ON THE KLONE AND I,"I read the first short few chapters of this book hoping that it would grab my interest. No hope, I didn't finish the book; too boring."
1,This was a book of nonsense and a complete disappointment.,I was extremely disappointed by this book. I had to force myself to finish it. The characters and storyline had no suspense or sense. Dont't waste your money!
1,Don't even bother to buy this one.,"I have, in my home library, EVERY Steel book in hardcover. She usually gets to the emotions of people and it's good escape reading. I love technology; but Steel's use of it is out of place. I was so sorry I purchased this one! It is awful! I will look up the reader comments before I buy her next one and then decide. Danielle Steel needs to regroup; go to a sunny island with the love of her life; or at the very least, re-read her earlier works. Sad, sad, sad!"
1,Absolutely unbelievable!,The subject matter of this book leaves a lot to be desired. The first 100 pages were okay but after that I could not wait to finish this book and put it down to never be opened again.
1,Totally a waste of time,"One of the worst books I've ever read. I have and have read everyone of D Steele's books, but if this is an indication of the direction she is going I won't be buying any more!!"
1,Borrow from the library. Don't spend your own money.,"I am a big Daniel Steel fan and was anxiously awaiting the opportunity to read her latest, The Klone and I. Although this was a very easy read it was NOT one of Steel's best. The plot was very unrealistic (even though cloning is big in the news) which made it hard to keep reading. Many of the events were very predictable and not much ""action"" was happening. This book was not like many of Steel's other best selling books, Silent Honor or The Long Road Home, which were hard to put down. Hopefully her next book will be better!"
1,Glad I borrowed it from the public library.,"Danielle Steel has her moments, and this wasn't one of them! I read the book in under five hours--including time out for dinner--and was glad it didn't take me longer. The first two chapters were great! They reminded me of a couple I know who had similar problems. After that, the book became a cop-out and silly. She tried had to rehash her own worn out storylines and thought she'd be cute by making the Klone be bionic! Hasn't Danielle read anything about the capabilites of today's cloning? Boring! Don't waste the time unless you have a specific need to read all her titles--and borrow if from the library!"
1,Awful!,"This is by far the absolute worst step workout I have ever tried! I am not a novice so it is not that I did not have the stamina or athletic prowess necessary to keep up, in fact I have been doing step aerobics for almost 15 years and I am a certified group fitness instructor who regularly incorporates step routines into classes. Amy Bento's advanced step is terrible - her cueing is done either as or after she has already completed the move and she repeatedly uses the same terms for different moves. This workout is confusing, overly complicated and probably dangerous for most casual exercisers. If you are looking for advanced chorography research Cathe Friedrich or Rob Glick workouts."
1,I Couldn't FORCE myself to read another PAGE!,"Since Danielle is one of my favorite authors,I kept making myself read ""just one more page"", to be absolutley certain that I actually HATED the book!After page 200, I gave it up. Now I know...I HATED IT---boring, boring, boring!"
1,Steel should be embarrased: Clone lovers?,"I am mystified why Steel would try to design a bionic robot that acts as normally and performs as well in bad as a real man. Yes, Steel has done this. There is Peter, a nice guy and high-tech manufacturer. Stephanie falls for Peter. Peter has to go away. He sends an identical Peter, whosename is Paul to take his place. Paul is a robot with a heart. She can hardly tell the two apart. The time frame is hard to follow. Weeks seem to pass without notice but also things go so fast that keeping track ishard. Her concluding chapter is a mockery of confusion and deception.Save your money. Look to Vickie Thompson or Debra Webb for romance andintrigue. Read MESSAGE FROM NAM. My favorite Steel book, especiallyappropriate around Easter, Thanksgiving or the gift giving seasons isTHE GIFT. Save your penny and postage."
1,Worst Book Ever,"Haven't read any of Danielle Steel's books in a long time because I was tired of the same old story over and over again. I decided to give her another try and picked this one up used. Waste of my $3.00, waste of my time spent reading it. Horrible story line, predictable main character again. Will never read another of her books."
1,"""The Klone"" really?",I first read this book a few years ago but I remember the plot and characters quite well. I wish very much that I didn't. It was boring and definitely uninspiring. It wasn't original and had no plot whatsoever and the characters had absolutely no depth. What in the world was Danielle thinking? I was just relieved that it was a very short book so I could finally be done with it.
1,Mindless Entertainment,"The Klone And I is a silly story of a love triangle between Stephanie,Peter and Peter's clone,Paul.The novel is simply outrageous and provides mindless entertainment.Too bad that this book got published.This is arguably the worst Danielle Steel novel I have ever read."
1,ZzZzZzZzZzZzZz,"I picked this book up at a used bookstore, hoping it would provide me with an hour or two of entertainment. Was I EVER wrong! I just couldn't get past the first chapter. Was it redundant or what? Boohoo. Her gold-digger husband leaves her. But she doesn't love him. But she did love him. But she doesn't anymore. He was her best friend, but he's not anymore. Over and over and over, Ms. Steele repeats herself. After Chapter One I was sure that she would continue with the same mindless repetitive junk. If Ms. Steele continues to write lackluster paperbacks, I'll stick with other writers. Maybe it's time for her to retire!"
1,A biotech failure,"Just like Ms. Steels other books, this also strives for a happy and fairy tale ending. But I have to sadly admit, that it was a miserable biotech mistake. The plot is living in super hi-tech times, as well as going about with daily chores like car pools and bluberry muffins. I couldn't decide the time frame this story was set in. It was a mistake trying to mix technology to that extend with simple household affairs."
1,Having problems to go to sleep?? This book's for you!,"I really am a big fan of Danielle Steel's books, but was I disappointed by this one! I looks as though she had to edit a book, no matter the content. I really didn't find the style I usually love, and the story really is bad. What is the point of telling us about bionic aerobics?? It doesn't sound real at all. Usually, i don't let her books down until it is finished, but i really had a hard time finishing this one, and to be honest, i didn't give a damn about the end of the book. If you are fans of Steel's books, do not read this book!"
1,Don't waste your time or money.,"Aside of ""Four Blondes"" by Candice Bushnell, this is hands down THE WORST book I have ever read. If you like Danielle Steel (as I do) you will be sorely disappointed. I felt as though she had made a committment to write a book by a certain date and cranked this one out in one evening while drunk. The story about a clone could have been interesting, had it been written more believably. Don't waste your time. If you want to read a good Danielle Steel, read ""The Ghost"" (my personal favorite) or ""Summer's End"" instead."
1,What was Danielle thinking?,I love Danielle Steel books. She has created some great female characters that I love being part of but I don't have a clue what she was thinking when she wrote this book. I can't give this book any stars. I kept reading thinking that somehow she would tie it all in together in a sensible fashion but she didn't. The main character has an affair with a clone? Please! I read until the end but I regretted sticking around so long!!!!! I only wished I hadn't bought the hardback and wasted so much money. Too far out!
1,Waisted time and money,"The story was the most silly and childish book that I ever read from this writer. Most dissapointed for a Danielle Steel novel. I had never had a book from Danielle Steel that I did not love but this one I don't know what else to say, bad, bad, bad!"
1,Don't Even bother to buy this book,"If you're going to read this book, don't. Just avoid it, even a die-hard Steel fan should not be exposed to such trash like this. Well, now that I think about it ALL of her books are trash, but I have enjoyed a few of her books, a FEW, excluding this one of course, it was terribly dull and common."
1,Desperate for income?,"I think it's been said - thank God - by a number of readers in different ways: ""What was Danielle Steel thinking when she wrote this?"" Did she need the money that badly? I have always enjoyed her novels even though the endings are becoming more and more predictable, because they allow me to escape and fantasize just a little. I couldn't even finish this, because the premise was so way out! Leave science fiction to the science fiction writers, Danielle."
1,Can I give it half a star? Or less?,This book was a complete disappointment and I wish I could get the hours of my life back that I wasted on this book.
1,i did not like it at all. i was disappointed.,"danielle steel is a wonderful author and i look forward to reading her books but this one was terrible,"
1,PATHETIC JUST ABOUT SUMS IT UP,"I bought this book with excitement. I read her other short work, THE GIFT, and liked it. I wasn't expecting another teenage story. This book was AWFUL. Ifound many instances where plot lines took a turn that couldn't be explained and then just went....nowhere. They were dropped completely! I have read every single book by Steel (being a big fan), but this was trash."
1,Amazon wouldn't let me give no stars!!,"I'm glad that I got this from the library instead of spending my money on it. The heroine of this book has no redeeming qualities; I was rooting against her for the entire book. Every plot 'twist' was screamingly obvious. The characters were under-developed, and a huge suspension of disbelief was required to buy into the whole story. I think this is the last Steel book that I will read."
1,"Boring, boring, boring","Steels' biggest mistake. Very boring, with no charm whatsoever. Big disappointment."
1,The WORST book I've ever read!,What a waste of time and money. Danielle....what were you thinking. I think everyone needs a refund.
1,Not Danielle Steele's style,"I am a collector of Danielle Steel's books. All are hardbounds, but 4. I guess you can tell by that, that I am a big Danille Steel fan, but I COULD NOT take this book. I read 3 paragraphs and will trade it in to the used book store I go to. This book was TERRIBLE, and I did not find anything funny in the first 3 paragraphs. I was just plain bored."
1,"Literature, it aint!","This had to be in my bottom 10 of all the books I have read in the 42 years of my life as an adult. The plot was not well defined. The characters were handicapped by their author. And the surprise, just wasn't one, after the `100th page. Oh, by the way, the writing was atrocious. What could her editor have been thinking??? The scariest thing about the book is that I gullibly paid $6.00 to read it. I had to give the book one star after trying to write this with no stars!"
1,Worst piece of writing I have ever read.,"First of all, her research was poor in certain areas. The drug Depakote is used for seizures and for Bipolar [Manic-Depressive] Disorder. What the psychiatrist in this poorly written novel should have ordered for the main character in this book was an anti-psychotic drug, not Depakote. Her grammar was poor, the story too loosely written, and her attempt at humor was sour. The only redeeming quality was that she didn't use her well-worn phrase 'huge blue eyes' at all in the book."
1,Bad,This was a boring book. I read all of Danielle Steel's books and this was one of her worst and most generic text.
1,Pathetic waste of paper,"What was Danielle Steele thinking (or smoking) when she wrote this book? Her books are usually quite good, but this one is far from it. The concept of a ""klone"" in a romance novel is intriguing --- What possibilities it could have! (Too bad Ms. Steele couldn't think of any.) The writing was poor and the attempts at comedy lame beyond belief. Thank goodness I rented the book from the library and didn't waste my money."
1,Shocking type of book for Danielle Steele,"I have read each and every book that Danielle Steele has written and have enjoyed each and everyone of them until......The Klone & I.What was she thinking to write such a horrible book - it was absolutely dreadful. I wish I could return this book and I thank heavens that I bought it in paperback instead of my usual hard cover. This book is now filed under ""G"" and I wouldn't even consider passing it on.Lori - Toronto, Canada"
1,Disappointing Reading,"I purchased this book thinking I was going to learn about Mr. Cayce's predictions - instead I learned about someone else's ""interpretations"" of his predictions ... and mostly his views of humanity. Disappointing!"
1,This can't be a Danielle Steel book!!,"I am an avid Danielle Steel reader, but this book was very disappointing. After reading the negative reviews, I purchased it anyway. It was not good reading even from the beginning; however I waded through it. I hope her next books are better than this one, or I will be an ex-Danielle Steel fan. I cannot believe she wrote such meaningless trash!!"
1,This book was not a very good book. It don't sound like her,"This book was good, but not like her normal books. It was too high-tech for me. I can't believe that she could write something like this. I feel that it was a poor one of her"
1,Dreadful,"Hands down one of the worst books I've yet to read, and by Danielle Steel of all people! PASS this book."
1,AMY BENTOS STEP DVD,"THIS DVD IS WAY TO DIFFICULT TO UNDERSTAND THE MOVES. WHEN YOU BUY A EXERCISE VIDEO YOU ARE READY TO JUMP IN AND START. THIS WOULD TAKE A MONTHS WORTH OF LESSONS TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO DO THIS. ONCE YOU FIGURE IT OUT, THEN YOU HAVE TO DEAL WITH HER LOUD VOICE YELLING AT YOU. I AM NOT IMPRESS AND WISH I COULD SEND IT BACK."
1,This was a very stupid story.,"I found the story unbelievable and stupid. The Klone was very unappealing, and the descriptions of how he dressed were a big turnoff. He just seemed like a big loser. I couldn't believe that a woman would accept expensive gifts from the Klone, knowing that her real love would end up paying for them. It was as if Stephanie was 13 years old when she was with the Klone, without any brains at all. I've read most of DS's books, and enjoy most of them. This seemed to have no romance at all. I finished the book only because I was hoping it would get better, which it didn't. The ending was predictable."
1,"A deplorable book about a silly, venal woman","I have never read a Danielle Steele book, and was appalled by ""The Klone & I"". What could possibly be romantic, or even amusing, about a woman who claims to love one man but is sleeping with another (even if he is a ""Klone""), lies to her children about it; accepts extremely expensive gifts from the Klone that she knows were charged to the boyfriend, has no job, hobby or any apparent purpose in life, and is stupid in addition to being venal? This book is so amoral that I, an atheist, was just repulsed. Pure trash and poorer fiction!!"
1,A boring and disappointing book.,What a disappointment! A boring story and uninteresting characters make you wonder how you managed to finish the book at all.
1,Poor characterization and lack of attention to detail.,"For years I'd wanted to pick up a book by Danielle Steel. I have been disappointed by this book. No plot, no character, no nothing! Get something else, PLEASE!!!"
1,Very poor!!!,"a story with a neurotic self-obsessed woman. This was very poor and I will hope upon hope that the next will be a tad better, come on, let's get it on!"
1,Cause of Death: Weak ending.,"Good beginning, a lot of distracting characterizations in the middle, and Steel's affliction for bad endings caused the death of this book."
1,Steel has gotten all too predictable.,"This book has convinced me to give up on Danielle Steel altogether. I loved her books, but this book has fallen into a predictable pattern and no longer interest me at all. What I most dislike about these books (and, unfortunately, this goes back to her earlier ones also--even though it didn't bother me as much then) is the way the female ALWAYS gets into danger herself toward the end of the book."
1,A boring read with little suspense,"This is obviously Ms. Steel's weakest story and by far the least romantic. The dialogue is trite and the relationships ""old"". It is more an expose on alternative lifestyles. I certainly hope the author can refresh herself next ""go around""."
1,forget it!,"I have always enjoyed Steel's books in the past...but forget this one! BORING!!!! It took determination and many efforts to finally finish, which I believe I should even have bothered to finish. Wait for her next book, or just get this in paperback, as if THAT would even be worth the price."
1,Very Predictable!,This book is an utter disappointment! It deviated from the usual suspenseful and riveting works of Steel. The plot and the characters are very predictable.This book is a waste of time and money!
1,FLUFF!!!,"This the first (and last) time I have read a Danielle Steel book. Talk about waste. This book is written for people that have a 5 second attention span. There is NO development of characters. The author glosses over months/years of time by saying... ""Five months later""... or ""It had now been three years..."" This book reminds me of a Melrose Place episode...a lot of action, no substance."
1,Definantly Different,"This book started out ok but into the fifth chapter it got a little bit ridiculous, that's when I stopped reading it. I have read a numerous amount of her books and this one is the worst yet. It was so predictable. I did read the last chapter, just to see what happened, and I would have to say that I knew the ending before I even finished reading it."
1,A big disappointment.,"I think that Mrs. Steel rushed a little too much with this one. The only reason I gave it a one-star rating was because it was the lowest possible score I could give. As a new dedicated Danielle Steel reader, I was disappointed that, unlike her other books, this one was very weak. When I first heard of this book, I ran to the library and read it, but was thoroughly bored once I started reading it. I hoped it would get better by the end, but unfortunately, it didn't. Try again, Mrs. Steel."
1,WARNING: STAND CLEAR AT LEAST 100 YARDS AWAY FROM THIS BOOK!,"As a newly devoted Daniell Steel fan, I was very disappointed to read this book, which seemed to be written at a third grade level. The plot and characters were weak, and the idea of falling in love with a cloned robot was repulsive to me. The only reason I gave this book a one star was because it was the absolute lowest rating I could give."
1,Dumb and Dumber,"I have to agree with others when I say ""1 star"" for this book is ""1 star"" too many! Ms. Steel should go back and review her earlier works!! Read ""The Long Road Home"" by Danielle Steel. That was her more recent GREAT book! The Klone had a totally unbelievable premise and was a waste of time!"
1,Not Up To Steels' Usual Standards,"As with all of her books, I eagerly awaited her latest work, and boy was I ever disappointed for the first time in all the years I've been reading her! While it is a thin,fast reading book, the plot-line was very easy to figure out. It is as if she just wanted to submit a quick story to his publisher but didn't really bother to go over it and polish it up. Sorry, but this was a true waste of time (and money). Hopefully her next will be back to her usual fine storytelling best."
1,Trite and Predictable,"I have always been a fan of Steels's. After reading the reviews in the publishing journals for The Klone and I, I fully expected to enjoy it. Now before you read the following, I have to admit that I am not the world's best judge of good writing and plots and been know to enjoy the trashiest of novels (I select fiction for a public library and am known as the Trash Queen for what I order). I finished the book but was quite annoyed with myself for doing so."
1,Not Worth Your Time,"I generally enjoy Steel's books. However this one I only finished to find out if she had invented a quirky finish. I felt it was poorly researched, quite repetetive and seemed to have been written in a hurry..If you are a Steel fan this one can be skipped. There are many more good fiction books on the market."
1,"1star for the 1st half, 0 for the ending.","I usually love DS, but this book was a major disappointment for me. I flew through the first half, thinking it was going to be a great read, but the last half was a complete let down. I hope she goes back to her surprise endings like in her older books."
1,Decent but not as good as her last books,I think that this book was totally predictable. You new what was going on by the first few chapters and the so-called surprise ending really wasn't a surprise at all because it was so predictable.
1,Not what I had expected,I haven't read Steel for many years. I bought this book with generally good memories of her previous works; I was very disappointed. A very quick yet superficial and disjointed read. I would not recommend this to anyone.
1,ONE OF THE WORST BOOKS I HAVE EVER READ,BEING A DANIELLE STEEL FAN I COULD NOT BELIEVE SHE WROTE THIS BORING STORY. IT WAS A MAJOR LETDOWN.
1,Not one of Danielle Steel's best books,"Danielle Steel is one of my favorite authors, but this book seemed like two or three other books I've previously read. Predictable."
1,Can't believe she put her name on this book of all things,Somelse must have ghost written this horror for Steel. Or else she must not have been feeling well at the time. A klone! It was a klone who did this!
1,A HUGE LOSS,"I am a huge Steel fan, and own all of her books - including this one, unfortunately. The characters are boring, and completely unsympathetic. You simply don't care about them, their lives or their careers. The characters are sophomoric and immature. They bumble through the plot. The plot revolves around divergent themes, that are never satisfactorily wrapped up. The book ends, leaving to many ends unexplained and completely without tie-in. Don't waste your money on the hardback edition, but I doubt they'll come out with a paper back for this one."
1,Just Plain Old Boring,"One of the few books I've read that I almost didn't finish. I read it all, but found no improvement by the end. I may never read again because of this! Okay, maybe that's a bit far, but this book was THAT bad."
1,Avoid this book for all possible costs,Not the ususal Danielle Steel type of book but I did enjoyed it very much
1,Did not like it at all,"Have always enjoyed Danielle Steel books until this one.Too many characters, rather confusing.No real suspense to it."
1,"Please, Spare me","Being a huge fan of Danielle Steel's novels, I thougth she had learned her lesson with The Gif- her readers didn't care for those characters - they're dull and there was no there, there."
1,a dissapointing read,I must confess - I have not completely read this book - I've struggled through 3 chapters and am only doing so out of loyalty to an author that I have followed since the begining of her career. This book can scarcely hold reader interest for more than 1 page at a time. The character names are annoying; I'm still waiting for something more interesting.Let's make this short and sweet - I hate this book.
1,Poorly Written,"After reading some of her previous works, I believe that this one was slapped together to meet a deadline. It lacks the characterization and thoughtful plot development"
1,"Weak Storline, Bad Characters","The story has no real point. It seems to go nowhere fast and gives us no real reasons to want to finish. Sorry .. but she can and has done much better in the past. Lets hope for a return to the intense, spine tickling novels of the past and that this was just a one-timer.A few friends and I are poking fun at this badly written book we for some odd reason chose to read for the Book Club."
1,This book was TERRIBLE!!!!!,"I have read every book Danielle Steel has written and this book is totally out of character for her. It is just silly and not very enjoyable at all. I am looking forward to reading Mirror Image, I hope it is as good as her old novels."
1,This is the worst novel ever.,"If I could rate this book zero stars I would. My mother and I both read her books and have always more than enjoyed them. However, we both bought this book on a mini-vacation and were horribly disappointed. Totally out of character for DS and utterly ridiculous. I am all for variety and a change of pace, but please."
1,I wanted back the time it took me to read this book!,I jumped on this book as I had every other Danielle Steele novel. Now I wish I had back the 4 hours it took me to read it. What a humongous waste of time! The story was ridiculous. I know that this is escapist reading but c'mon! Danielle Steele should stick to historical fiction - A Ghost Story was 100 time better!
1,Not one of her best works.,"I didn't like the ""Klone"". I thought it was too far fetched a story. I love most of her books but this is at the bottom of my list."
1,Lousy - A waste of time,"My daughter needed a book to read for school. Never having read Danielle Steel before I gave her the book to read thinking it had to be a good comedy, all of Danielle Steel's books are good (I hadn't read it yet). After completing the book my daughter said she wasn't interested in reading anymore of Danielle Steel. Confused by her comments, I read the book and agreed with my daughter. The book is ridiculous and shallow. Now that Daniell Steel has tried comedy, she should go back to what she's good at."
1,Ridiculous,"No wonder there were two copies available on the library shelf. It's not a good read. This book starts out okay but once the klone comes into the picture, its all downhill from there. Unbelievable & idiotic plot. I lost interest around chapter 4. The daughter was more mature than the mother. I didn't expect much from this book but it was worse than I thought. Thankfully I didn't buy this book & hopefully the next one is a lot better."
1,Worst Steel Yet!,I'm usually the first of my friends to read a new Steel and then I pass the book along for the others to read. This time we didn't bother to go any further than myself. I don't know what Ms. Steel was thinking but she should stay with what we all know and love and leave the sci-fi & tech to those that write it regularly.
1,Forget THIS,"A large online bookclub I'm in decided to read this book, heh, what a BIG mistake. Practically everyone hated this book, except this true die-hard Danielle Steel fan of ours.Hehe, to have some fun we all- yes ALL- of us decided to write a review for The Klone and I on Amazon.com, on the same day. I must say, there will be a barrel of laughs for all of us."
1,Hard to learn,"It is what the title says, Advanced Step. I have several CD's and this one I can't get all the way through without getting frustrated with the complexity of step. I just want a good workout."
1,Skip This Baby For Your Sanity,"I borrowed this book on tape from the library for a long drive across the state. I had only read a few Daniel Steel books and I thought the book would at least relieve me from the boredom and monotony of the drive. The only thing I was relieved of was reality. I can't believe an author would intentionally make their main character so ignorant and unbelievable. Why is this ""heroine"" satisfied to play victim in her idiot boyfriend's plot to subject her to his alter ego? Is this type of character what women really want to read about? The only redeeming side of this book was to share it with my co-workers and laugh about how ridiculous the plot and characters were. I often wonder what other motorists thought as they passed me protesting out loud in my car at how stupid the characters and plot was."
1,Amazing it's still on the bestseller list,"Okay, I'm guilty. I read this book when it first came out in hardback. What I can't understand is WHY it's still on the bestseller list! Look at the reviews. They're terrible! Aren't people reading them or are they just buying the book just because it's Danielle Steel? Get a life people, buy good books by good authors, not terrible books just because it's by Danielle Steel!"
1,Not on the same level as some of Steel's other books.,"The Klone and I was a bit disappointing. It might be a fine light read, but don't expect anything on the level with The Ghost or The Long Road Home."
1,Confusing,Steel writes great stuff that keeps you on the edge of your seat. This one seems to cheat. What is going on in this book ?!
1,WHO TOLD THIS WOMAN SHE COULD WRITE??,"Talk about writing for the simple-minded. And did someone say, ""surprise ending?"" I had it all figured out by the end of the first chapter, INCLUDING the so-called exciting climax. This story has already been done--about a hundred times! Maybe that's why it is so predictable? Anyway, it reminded me of why I've never cared for Danielle Steele's books. I'll never read another one!"
1,The same old DS stuff.,This book is a typical DS stuff. The main twist in the plot is on an very weak foundation. Expected more out out of this book.
1,"Too, shallow","I started out enjoying the suspense Steel offered with his earlier books, however the last three disappointed me."
1,Worn out theme and totally predictable,I was very disappointed in Steel's latest outing. I've always enjoyed her books. I had the entire story figured out by the time I reached page 50.
1,I can't believe I paid money for this book.,"I will never believe that Danielle Steel actually wrote this book. How can the same woman who gave us such depth and intrigue and perfection in previous works allow her name be attached to this? With each new book released, the quality goes downhill. I will be hard-pressed to EVER read another Danielle Steel novel. This latest was absolute drivel. It really hurts, too. The story is there, but it just was not written with the quality that I know her is capable of. I am not exaggerating. I have every single work of his, in hardback, and buy each new work the day it is released. I feel like I have been sucker-punched. They released a book with her name, just so her fans would buy it blindly. I did. I won't again. I will definitely preview first, with my own two eyes."
1,NOT UP TO PAR!!!!!,I have been a huge Steel fan for 15 years. I must say I have been disappointed with her last few books...and now this!!! It was written at about a 5th grade level.
1,Do not buy this book. You have been warned.,"My advice to anyone that has not already bought this book is to borrow it or check it out at the library. The best advice would be to get a summary of what happened, (which is not much) and wait and see what the next book brings. By way of buying the books with my money you're selling yourself out. If more readers would do the same, maybe authors would think twice about releasing garbage to make money."
1,Bad book,"This book was plain old horrible. There's no other way to explain how it was, it was just BAD. Really truely BAD."
1,"You have got to be kidding, Ms. Steel!","Unfortunately I'm extremely backlogged on my reading and currently have 5 Danielle Steel books in the cue. I just finished ""The Klone and I"" and have lost my enthusiasm for my marathon Steel sessions. Do I dare pick up another one of her books on the off chance that it will just as disappointing? My advise is to steer clear of this outlandish fantasy. It is too far out there to be believable."
1,Save your money; go to the library,"The book is a creative idea but Danielle Steel copped out at the end. I was very disappointed. Usually I like her books. Save your money and wait for a friend to buy it so you can borrow it. But then again, you can't get your time back from reading it."
1,The worst Danielle Steel book written,"Do not waste your time ( even the 1 hour it took to read it was too much!). The premise is preposterous and though it started out fine, it very quickly deteriorated!"
1,Just awlful!,"I have read all of Danielle Steels books and am an avid fan of hers. I always purchase her books in hardback the minute they are on the shelf: as I did with this book. For the first time ever, I just hated her work. I kept reading it in the hope it would get better. No luck. It's unrealistic, gimmicky, boring, and a waste of money. I took the book back. Listen to your readers and forget this new form."
1,what a crazy story,"i have read almost of all of danielle steel's books, and this definitely was one of her worst. after reading such a great story as The Long Road Home, which i thought was her best, i feel she must have just plain run out of ideas. i found myself chuckling at the story because it was so far-fetched."
1,it not a danielle steel book,I love to read Danielle Steel but this book was a total shock. I did not like it all. Too weird for me.
1,The Klone and I: A High-Tech Love Story,"This was truly the worst book I've ever read. The characters were unbelievable and the story line was absurd. The characters had bad attitudes and I wouldn't even want to know these people. I tried to get into the story line but couldn't draw myself into it because it was so insane. I was also disappointed in the writers repetition of rhetorical questions and inability to move on with the thought process.Just to give you a taste, there was a klone of a perfect mate that was made of wires etc. Steph has great sex with this klone as they do triple and quadruple flips throughout their sexual encounters. Steph thinks she has to make a choice between this wired klone and the real thing. I've read some of Danielle's good work but I can't believe they published this one."
1,The Klone and I,"I had to see what others thought,that's why I signed on here... This has the be one of the worst books I have read in years... Do hope that there isn't anything seriously wrong with Daniele Steel. I once was a fan of hers and read most of her novels until I found myself bored with the plots and the words became repetitious.... I always laughed when I came across the much used word CHARGRIN... think that's when I switched to other writers for my pleasure... back to this one... I am shocked that it was ever published... if I wasn't laid up with a sprained ankle I am sure I never would have continued to the end of the story, it was that bad...The only saving grace was that I bought the book at a garage sale.. for .50... way, way, overpriced though... my daughter just informed me she is starting a book by Danille Steele... ""The Cottage"", for her sake I do hope that it is of some value.... as for me, doubt, I would ever try another of her books."
1,Is she kidding?,"I've read nearly every one of Danielle Steel's vast collection of novels...and this is ""hands down"" the VERY WORSE piece of garbage she's ever written. What a joke! It was as if one of Ms Steel's enemies broke into her house and forced her to write this mess!Don't bother!"
1,Booorrrringgg,This book was so boring and lacked all descency that are normally in Steel's books. If you like a NICE love story don't read this or you will be greatly disappointed.
1,Lame as hell,"this book was pretty bad.. IT had no story point and i think the things with the klones was stupid. But i gave it another star just because she is danielle steel , and she is the shizzel..hey we all make mistakes..."
1,Not much,"Very disappointing. Not much a selection of recipes. Very small book. I've bought other ""Better Homes and Gardens"" recipe books and this is definitely not their best."
1,This book gets my top honor of....,"...the stupidest book I have ever read. I kept waiting for the book that would have a different plot from all the others she has written, and this is what we got. Needless to say, this was the straw that broke that camel's back and I will never read another Danielle Steel book ever again."
1,Steel's worst ever!,"I am a Danielle Steel fan, therefore I just coudn t believe that she had written this lausy book!I am just sorry that I ever bought this book."
1,Don't waste your time.,"This book was not only a total waste of time, it was a senseless waste of the lumber it took to create the paper it was written on. By far the worst book I have ever had the misfortune of purchasing. Amazon...this book is not worthy of even one star but that was the least you allow us to give."
1,THE WORST BOOK I EVER READ,"not only was this the worst book I ever read, it was by far Steele's worst book ever written. I hope Steele's Klone that wrote this book is GONE and the real STEELE will return for a terrific comeback."
1,Unrealistic,Just a pretty book to look at. How many people actually have lofty ceilings with space for a crystal chandelier or even room for a built-in bookcase in their bathroom? Give me a break. These were nothing more than fantasy bathrooms in a coffee table book.
1,disappointing,"there was nothing, either aesthetically or eroticaly, to justfy the sale of this book."
1,A Few Quick Pointers For Potential Buyers,"-It is a small, soft cover book. Not a great coffee table book.-Images are shown in black and white.-There are no face shots.-In case it wasn't immediately apparent, the focus is squarely on the penis.With all of that in mind, I have to say that I really loved this book. Giovanni is quite brave here - he acknowledges and embraces the eroticism and desire associated with the male member. Cropping out their faces removes the distraction of personality, and allows Giovanni to accomplish his goal of having the reader focusing on the variation, individuality, and overall beauty of the organs between these men's legs.The images push the boundaries of what is regarded as art, but the photos are never vulgar or pornographic. After reading the background to the cover image, even that can be seen as an expression of fraternity and male solidarity rather than sexuality.Great book, great photos, well worth buying."
1,Problematic,Made of cheap plastic. Handle does not remain screwed into head. Should have gone to big box store & bought a metal one w/handle that works. This one waste of money.
1,Consuelo and Alva Vanderbilt: The story of a Mother and a Daughter,Was not able to read beyond page 74 in my Kindle as the book was totally screwed up; letters and numbers interspersed throughout; suddenly you would be at the end of the book.....totally messed up in the Kindle version. Finally gave up and deleted it.VERY DISAPPOINTED.
1,I cannot recommend this book.,This book was very disappointing. All characters were wishy-washy and uninteresting. This story could have been told in a novel half the size. It was drawn out with meaningless dialogue. I've never seen a hero and heroine with less chemistry than the two in this book.What exactly was the point of the heroine having sex with a man who contributed nothing to the story line? He and his son came in and out of the story without a purpose. If there was a purpose then Ms. Taylor Quinn failed to deliver it.Ms. Taylor Quinn should stick to writing for Harlequin Superromance. This book was truly her worst work.
1,Not Bad and Not Great!!!!,"Charm looks much better in the picture, of course I understand that it's much smaller in person. The quality is not that great, unlike the description. I've seen much better in the stores!! I will not return it because the shipping will cost me more than the charm is worth. Too bad for me, I've learned my lesson! Thanks anyway - my fault!"
1,A letdown,"I practically salivated at learning that Liszt had written a biography of his colleague, Chopin. Upon reading it, I was thoroughly disappointed and stopped halfway through. Essentially, the problem stems from the fact that the narrative is full of verbiage that gives almost no facts about Chopin, but engages in endless verbal diarrhea; it seems that Liszt did not actually write the bulk of the book, but some bimbo who had the reputation of loving to talk at length without actually saying anything.Next time I will buy a real biography of Chopin."
1,Received broken teacups,"2 of the cups were broken when package opened. Not enough packaging material to insulate the cups from the delivery person just ""dropping"" it off at the door. Disappointed."
1,Great suction but leaks!!!,Used this to change ATF in a BMW and after the first fill it started to leak. I bought this based on other reviews. Buyer beware.
1,Group Smith CD not so good,"Bought one of these Italian remakes on an auction site for $30, shouldn't have paid more than $3 for it. It is not remastered and the quality of the audio is the worst I've ever heard on a CD. To sum it up, TERRIBLE. I've learned there is another version of this CD which IS digitally remastered and includes five bonus tracks. It's a bit hard to find but worth the hunt."
1,A Group called Smith,I am very happy with the music. What I am not happy with is the way the cd is formatted Ican not down load it to my computor for my Ipod. Tried to call Dave at Hatboro music store but they closed their doors and he is selling stock from his home!
1,Not Pleased,"Very unhappy with purchase. Very poor quality. Wear 18 hour bras,snaps to close together to fit straps properly. More trouble to return than it is worth. Straps to long, for my taste. Do Not waste your money. Also cancer warning on box, This product known to the state of California to cause cancer and birth defects (FYI)."
1,Disappointing,"I LOVED Prep and American Wife. This was just NOT as good. Boring, generic,...like a bad paperback romance novel from a grocery store."
1,"Ok video, not a ""workout""","This video is just okay. Its only 45 minutes long, including 10ish minutes of warm-up. The audio and video quality is bad at times. It goes over a few kicks, two punching combinations, and then jumps right into the Poomsae. That review is pretty good and helpful. Overall though, the video wasn't really worth my time, and definitely isn't a ""workout"" video."
1,crap,This is generic crap. I'm so sorry I ever purchased it. What a waste of time and money. Don't buy!
1,Snooze,"I picked up The Man of My Dreams because, like other reviewers, I loved Prep. But I found myself quitting this one about halfway through. The plot is nearly identical to that of Prep, but Hannah doesn't have the same kind of depth as Lee Fiora does. Hannah's depressive mopiness got to me at times, and I found myself thinking, ""who cares?"" It was almost as though Sittenfeld had taken the characters of Prep, changed their names, and made them older. Sittenfeld vehemently denies that her writing is chick lit, but there's definitely a chick lit feel to her books--with, of course, the depressed teenager/ twentysomething.In all, this was a highly disappointing book because the author has so much talent as a writer, but very little creativity to create new characters outside of those that she knows. If you liked Prep, don't say I didn't warn you about The Man of My Dreams. It's just not up to what Sittenfeld put out the first time around."
1,"""I wanted to like it, but....""","I loved Ms. Sittenfeld's first novel, ""Prep,"" and I recommended it to everyone I know who reads. I wish I could say the same for ""Man of My Dreams,"" but no. In fact, I am just going to drop it into the book return bin at the public library as an anonymous donation.There is no doubt that this author is an extremely gifted writer, and that does come through in this book. Unfortunately, it still bored me into a coma. I forced myself to finish it, but my mind kept drifting as I considered putting it down and making a red velvet cake, which would have been so much more satisfying. I wanted more characterization and plot to chew on, but I was left grinding my teeth.Maybe Ms. Sittenfeld's publisher rushed her into a second book, or perhaps I expected too much after ""Prep."" Anyway, I do believe that she will give us more gems in the future. I'm not giving up on this writer."
1,Very disappointing,"Zyflamend Liquid - Promotes A Healthy Inflammation Response, 2 oz., (New Chapter)This was the nastiest (sorry, but it fits) tasting liquid I have ever tasted. There was no way I could use the product enough to determine if it was effective for me."
1,Not nearly as good as the first novel,"Prep was quite a good novel. The follow-up, The Man of My Dreams, is ... well, it's simply not nearly as good.The main character has real self-esteem issues. And while I might expect them in a young woman, the length of time it takes her to deal with them is excruciating. Even when people genuinely like her, she has a very hard time believing it. All that negativity is hard to take; a character needs to grow or there is no point in reading about them.She does finally get a backbone, but you have to read through a whole lot of nothing to get there. And I'm not quite sure the journey was worth it."
1,No need or audience for this one.,"I would not consider assigning or recommending this title to my students who are going to read Iliad IX in Greek. The late Malcolm Willcock's commentary on Books I-XII (ISBN 185399507X) costs only three dollars more, is certainly the equal of this one in critical acumen and literary appreciation, and is more helpful on the Greek. (And of course, it also covers books 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, and 12.) Griffin is aware of Willcock's work, which he rightly describes as ""unpretentious and helpful"" (p. 47). He has not produced new material that will require students or scholars to notice his little book."
1,"Izrador, or Isengard?","This is the second release of this line since it's come under a new developer, and frankly, I think FFG needed to end the line if they weren't interested in producing it in house. The writing is flat and listless, and the feats and prestige classes are unbalanced. The authors seem to be trying to create a whole book out of what should be a small area in a main book, and I'm wondering why the push for all these new books, if a new edition of the main book is forthcoming. This information could have easily been put in there, instead of a freestanding item. A waste."
1,Not much to work with,"I don't find this book worth the cover price, especially not with a new edition coming out soon. The authors try to portray gritty reality, but it comes off sounding like some sort of dime store novel. I found it to be overly dramatic, and very limiting on the GM. The NPCs are pretty much unbelieveable, and the product itself is lightweight. At least it's not as overpriced as some of the other products. Not reccommended."
1,Attractive -- and useless,"This is an attractive grater, and it is relatively sturdy (though some of the chrome you see is actually plastic). But there are core problems, which I have experienced in the 8 months I have owned it. I frequently grind spices.The first problem is that it is hard to load. The bizarre engineering requires that you open the grater in the middle, which causes all the whole nutmegs to fall out. It is awkward to keep the nutmegs inside while also loading the nutmeg which is currently being grated.The more important problem is a fatal design flaw in how the nutmeg being grated is held. Generally, it grates a nutmeg part of the way, and then the ""teeth"" inside which grip the nutmeg strip the nutmeg (like stripping a screw), and you are unable to continue grating. The result is that I have a lot of half-grated nutmegs.It might, nevertheless, be your best option."
1,Poco Indian Summer,"Quality not as good as would be expected. Way past flat in the treble direction. However, great band ,great music!"
1,The magic is gone,"The album shows the end of the magic. After recently seeing Poco in concert and hearing some of the early golden hits, I started at the beginning of their career and listened once again to all of the preceeding releases. Alas, when I reached this one, there was nothing. Indian Summer is a good (though overplayed in its time) song, but after that there is nothing on the release which makes you even want to here the song all the way through. Stick with the earlier releases where either the country rock ruled, or the harmonies were incredible. Here you get neither."
1,4 Billion Bucks 3D,This movie was a total waste! The minute I got from it was so horrible! It's a total waste of money! The camera man must of been on LSD when he was filming it.
1,Disappointing,"Was expecting much more from the author after Prep. Although not a complete waste of time, this book does little to endear us to the protagonist or say anything original about life."
1,"2004 remaster is a ""Lemon""","""Indian Summer"" is certainly a 4 star album. The last album recorded with Tim Schmit before he went off to join the Eagles, the songwriting is top notch here.Unfortunately, the Lemon reissue is clearly pulled from a vinyl source NOT the original mastertapes. Why didn't Lemon use the mastertapes or a safety master from the UK? Unfortunately only the label knows because the packaging is quite nice including a nice replica of the original insert with the lyrics and album credits.The sound on this remaster is compressed and harsh as well as much too bright sounding. Perhaps this is a means to hide the source material--I'm not sure but this is NOT the version to get.Avoid this edition and try and find the MCA original CD release.Original Album: 4 starsOriginal CD master: 4 starsThis remaster: 1 starAvoid."
1,Definitely not a page-turner,"I just read Hill's latest book, ""The Woodsman"", and it was very good. The characters were well developed and interesting; the story was fantastic.This first book (""A Clubbable Woman"") in the Pascoe and Dalziel series was rather boring. Uninteresting characters, including Pascoe and Dalziel, dull story. Knowing something about rugby and the local English dialect and slang might make things a little easier to follow. I'm a Henning Mankel, Jo Nesbo, and Michael Gruber fan, so this series just doesn't cut it for me, so far. I hear it's a fairly popular series, and I'm willing to try one more novel in it. But to stick with it, the next book better be much improved."
1,Very light load capacity,Don't use with anything over 200 watt start-up load. This thing will burn up with anything more. That means start-up load. I don't know about run-load: mine burned up with a 600 watt start-up load.
1,Crusty bagels,"I eat a bagel every morning and share it with my son. We eat large bagels (the kind made fresh by the grocer) so they just barely squeeze into the slicer. This helped with the uneven cutting issue like other reviewers noted, but for some reason the bagels toast differently than when you cut them with a knife. I think it's because the structure of the bagel gets crushed during cutting. My bagels came out hard and crusty most of the way through. I like them softer. Maybe freezing my bagels after cutting them has something to do with it too. Regardless, I have gone back to cutting them with a knife."
1,time on my hands,"This was light entertainment that ultimately disappointed. Borrowing heavily from Replay, Back to the Future, and Jack Finney (old photos to lend credibility) this comes across as the plot of a Quantum Leap episode. However, the highly negative opinions expressed about a highly regarded American are too heavily handed and the main character has some glaring character flaws that are too easily glossed over. I missed the bantering between Sam and Al. Needs a sequel to remedy the letdown of not even a hint of a solution. If you want to devise your own alternative endings then write your own story! Again, ok for an afternoon on the veranda but I preferred the Delorean over the boat. Keep trying Peter, Matheson and Finney are hard to match."
1,Cruxshadows Saves It,"I bought this CD while lurking around the ""Goth"" section of a local music store. I must say, the theme seemed interesting enough, so I thought I'd give it a try. I wish I could say some great things about it, but I'd be lying. The only good cut on the entire CD is ""Deception"" by the Cruxshadows, which mixes lovely Goth/synth beats with the beautiful music of the band's equally beautiful violinist. Other bands featured are Beborn Beton, Wench, Bella Morte, and Neuroactive, though this matters little as their songs aren't worth listening to. ""Prey"" by Seraphim Shock is decent enough, but the band is really no more creative than any of the other talentless artists they share CD space with."
1,Trouble from the start,"The first hurdle you have to overcome with this book is accepting the fact that the best use for a time machine in 1994 is to go back and prevent a two time, democratically elected president from being a two time, democratically elected president.Once you get past that, you have a pretty shallow story. The lead character isn't very likeable, there is no character development and the circumstances surrounding young Dutch Reagan's second passing are just plain silly.On the bright side Mr. Delacorte does a fine job taking the reader through the golden era of Hollywood and the Los Angeles area circa 1938.In summary, if you hate Ronald Reagan this book is for you. If you're looking for a good piece of fiction then look elsewhere."
1,Guillotine Slicer,Slicer does not cut all the way thru the bagel on the first try. Bagel must be rotated 1/4 turn and cut again
1,Blade does not lock to base and does not slice thoroughly,"My biggest complaint (which is the main reason I returned it) is that you can't just pick the slicer up by the handle to move it. There is no locking mechanism, so when you go to grab the handle to pick it up (say to put it back in the cabinet), you only pick up the blade and not the bottom part. To move the contraption you have to pick it up from the bottom. The fact that the blade doesn't lock to the base is annoying, inconvienent and possibly dangerous.It also doesn't cut all the way through the bagel, english muffin, or whatever else you decide to put in there."
1,time travel lover,"I enjoyed the basic story in this book however Mr. Delacorte needs to get over his Reagan hatred or at least subdue it a smidge!Sheesh, the repeated cheap shots and Reagan-ranting came close to ruining an otherwise good book. If you don't mind wading through the author's personal hangups then you'll probably enjoy the book.The end of the book was like hitting a wall. I thought someone had torn a few pages out of my book. The ""leave 'em wanting more"" theory was a little abrupt here."
1,Zenith C35A26 Keeps Shutting Itself Off!,"We've had this tv since May 2003. Intermittent problems began in August. The power stays on, but the screen goes blank and sound is gone. At times, the picture and sound will come back within 5-10 minutes.The bug is still intermittent, sometimes occurring 5-6 times a day, but it never fails when a repair technician is present.Any suggestions or information on known bugs affecting this model?"
1,not so good,"This is not so good. only if someone offers it for free, get it... else not worth the money its asking for."
1,non working software,"I tried installing this software. It installed. But when I tried to run the application, it gave an error message about sound installation and quit running. What an useless software."
1,Just a little better than OK,"I got this as part of my kids' curriculum for this year. Whilst the articles about the different countries are good and informative, the link to update the information is obselete. The maps are quite good, but I cannot get a close-up version of any map, so when the kids are to find a particular island that is smaller than say, 200 miles wide, it will be invisible. Like I said in the title, it's a little better than OK."
1,Leo Buscalia audio cassette purchase,Product was described as new. Upon receipt the original packaging had been opened several times. Returned product for full refund. This was my first and last purchase from Amazon due to the deceptive advertising I encountered.
1,"Ok, but nothing great","First off, I can't even register it because the domain doesn't exist in the first place! second, i can't run the atlas because it says the sound devices were installed incorrectly, now who's fault is that? I didn't install it, it installed automatically! The articles are a little too brief too, and the encyclopedia has a hard time connecting to my cable modem to get on the internet. These are not things i would expect from a professional encyclopedia. If i could do it again i would pay the extra 10$ and get the encarta."
1,Disappointment!,"I received the bolero bracelet today and I was disappointed! Its much smaller than illustrated and the metal looks like silver! I can usually tell the difference between platinum, white gold and silver. This looks cheap."
1,awful service,the product was wrong. never got the right one. had to take action with amazon to even get my money back. was worst experience. & thats putting it nicely.
1,"some good graphics, that's it","there were some cool graphics here, but other than that, it was the worst game ever. i agree with one of the other reviewers when they said ""have the creaters of this game people ever played a game before?"" Put it this way- i had to use the walkthrough for every single move i made. i solved the puzzles on my own, and some i thoroughly enjoyed, but the puzzles alone were not worth it. if you do decide to get this game, find a walkthrough online immediately and just use it to guide you to the puzzles (if you are like me and just enjoy tough stand-alone puzzles). But if you want a good story line and good game play, this will be your worste nightmare. navigations is unbearable at times. i got stuck numerous times as well. had to go back to a saved spot. it crashed on my a couple times too, and i lost everything because i forgot to save. stay away from this one. seriously. the gameplay and story is horrible."
1,Journey to the Center of WORTHLESS,"Although a newer game, the interface is similar to the early 1990's adventure games where nothing can really be figured out. Dont waste your money on this!!! take it and go buy the movie (several old versions) or pick up a copy of Rick Wakeman's Journey to the Center of the Earth - Its much more satisfying!"
1,Why?,Why would ANYONE want to prevent Ronald Reagan from becoming President? Is THAT the premise of a book?? Has the author not benefitted from the prosperity and peace that era has brought? Who helped bring down the Iron Curtain/Berlin Wall? Perhaps we should time travel back to the Clinton White House / playboy mansion wannabe days. Swill at the public trough!
1,Some things don't make any sense,"I enjoyed this game at times, but it aggravated me to have to rely on the walkthtough for some of the puzzles. Those I had help on would have taken weeks to figure out and the final answer so obscure that it would simply have been trial and error, no logical outcome. Also some of the items you had to combine to do stuff did not seem logical either. If you already have a knife, why would you have to combine 2 or 3 other things to do what the knife could do? Dealing with the cursor was difficult also for the same reasons mentioned in the other reviews. I would recommend this game to someone who doesn't mind relying on walkthroughs and has infinite patience. The story was interesting but loses a lot when it's so hard to play it out yourself."
1,TERRIBLE,"I usually don't play these type of adventure games, but it did sound interesting. However, I found out very early on in the game that you have to print out the manual to start the game moving forward. The cursor with the hand that is suppose to allow you to collect items, did not work all the time. I was unable to understand what I was suppose to do inside the caves since none of the items were working.Very disappointed in the game. I think that the maker of the game should try having people play this game before releasing it to the public, or at least test it and make sure that it works."
1,Avoid this one!,"I am a big adventure game fan - thought this one might be along the lines of Syberia - WRONG! This game had an interesting premise but was absolutely painful to play even when consulting a walkthrough every other minute. The character was hard to navigate, the puzzles completely non-intuitive (who would think to get rid of a t-rex, you had to mix a leaf, twine, paint, and blackened pear to make fireworks which then you had to launch out of a hollow log???) AHHHHHHH! Also because of the super rigid gameplay, you would be unable to do one thing without completing some other menial task, so you would be hunting like crazy for the one little thing you didn't do - and this is after following the walkthrough verbatim. Please play only in the event of a pandemic and you are trapped in your house for weeks and have no other means of entertainment."
1,Wrong title,"After watching the no talent Knotts acting like a jerk(once again), this movie should be named ""GAS"", because that what it gave me after this so-called junk. My ten year old can do better with a 8mm camera. END"
1,Gus,"Walt Disney would turn over in his grave, had he seen this. But what do you expect, it is a movie about a mule kicking field goals. Besides a few amusing parts, Don Knotts is not up to par in this one. If your looking to occupy your kids time, this is not the movie."
1,Don't waist you money!,Don't waist your money on this video! It is very dumb! Not recommended. Really no point to the movie. The playback from Amazon was great though.
1,Hard to Believe...,"I would give this software no stars if I could!This program came on my iMac in 2003 and was an awesome product. However after paying for the 2004 edition I found that updates are no longer available. That means that no articles from 2004 are available to me. I used the given e-mail address to inquire about this problem, only to be told that this was only a temporary situation. Today I clicked on the link to contact World Book, and it no longer works. I would ask for my money back, but there doesn't seem to be any way to get in touch with the company. The part of this that I find hard to believe is that this product is still for sale.CUSTOMER BEWARE is all that I can say at this point."
1,Four Billion Bucks 3D-not,"It seemed like a cult film. The 3D effect did not work. I have a 3D TV and one that is not and could not watch it with either TV, let alone with or without glasses. Total waste of money."
1,Beyond Horrible,Rented this for the 3D affect. The 3D was bad at best and the movie itself reminded me of a boring acid trip (is such a thing possible?). If you are trying to get into 3D this ain't the place to start.
1,Poco Indian Summer,"This is a four or five star album, but I have only given one as Lemon Records cds are often mastered from vinyl. This is no exception and the Japanese edition is far better with no vinyl noise. Unfortunately, it is more expensive, but if you like this album, it is certainly worth it."
1,Where did she go wrong?!?,"I loved the Untamed series and think of Lowell as a pretty good writer in general and a great writer when compared to others in her genre. This book was just plain stupid. Dumb characters, dumb plot, dumb writing! Ok the nookie scenes were up to her usual par, but aside from that it was pretty silly."
1,Skip This One!,I suffered through this in audiocassette form and my head is still throbbing from the incessant drum references throughout the story. I am a true fan of the author but this is certainly a book to forget.
1,Tepid and embarrassingly dramatic,"When the descriptions of Mauna Loa and volcanic regions Kilauea breathes more sprite and fire than the romance, it becomes crystal clear that the classic love story is tepid and embarrassingly melodramatic with one-dimensional characters who are too brittle to hold against the majestic Hawaiian background of the story. Nicole Ballard haunted by the emotional scars and label as frigid by her ex, relives her humiliation when Chase Wilcox, a volcano expert and misoygnst thinks her brazen to break his brother's marriage attempts to seduce her and pour cold water. Nicole is too dishy and wimpish; and Ms. Lowell attempts to cover up the insubstantial plot. The emotional honesty and cool-headed heroines are sadly elusive in this lackadaisical romance that does injustice to the readers as well as the author."
1,Didn't knock me outa my socks,"This is a handy tool if you can't our are uncomfortable having a knife or multi tool. However this is not the item you want to rely on to get you through a tough spot. More of a hey i don't have to look for this other tool. I don't expect it will last more than a few uses, and would not purchase it again."
1,Not worth re-publishing,I've enjoyed other books by Elizabeth Lowell but this one was decidedly below her usual quality. The characters were a little flat and she was not up to her usual research standards. While most of her information on volcanos rang true she made a lot of errors involving local Hawaiian culture and fact that I could recognize after living in Honolulu for only three years. Clearly she never had anyone from Hawaii read and critique the book. Skip this book and wait for a NEW book unless you are a die-hard Lowell fan.
1,Going nuts trying to get the screws in!,"I was so happy when I received this table, but when I tried to put it together, it just drives me nuts!!! It's impossible to get the any of the screws to go all the way in. I tried rubbing soap on the screw threads and that almost get the last screw I tried to go in but it still got stuck (and the screw head was stripped so I can't drive it in any further)! I gave up and now I'm not sure how to return such a heavy table, after spending all these money. :[...]"
1,cherry childrens table and chairs,"This set is very dark, reddish stain and I would consider it more like a mahogany than cherry. The finish on the top of the table was rough and irregularly applied.I returned it and kept the ""pecan"" finished table even though it is more like a natural cherry than Pecan colored."
1,worst furniture every bought,"I just bought it a week ago. One of the screw for the chair cannot be fasten at all, remain loose. It appears that the hole is too big for the screw. Table is far from be sturdy. The set looks nice but not safe."
1,Cook Book,I'm not too excited about this book. Most of the recipes in it are things I wouldn't want to eat....
1,...blood on the keyboard,"Hard to open, hard to work. Great idea in theory. Needs some design work. I can't recommend it until then."
1,"Damaged, bad stain, and red!","I ordered this set for my son as well as the 2 extra chairs. I opened it to find that there was not only a bad stain job on the table top, it was also cracked. There was a spot that didn't get stained as dark as the rest right in the center of the table. You would think that wouldn't pass Quality Control before they sent it out. Guessing the crack happened during shipping, there was hardly any padding in the box despite containing the table and 2 chairs. Also, the color is red, not anywhere near cherry or what is pictured. I'm not paying an additional $50 for espresso color and also they don't sell the extra chairs, so I'll have to live with it. I hope the replacement is better. Disappointing, as I was not able to have this in time for my son's birthday with the damage. Will update review after the replacement comes."
1,"Drop ""Eden Burning"" Into the Nearest Volcano","That's where this book belongs. As a long-time fan of Elizabeth Lowell, I eagerly await her new releases. I wish I had skipped this one; ""Eden Burning"" was a big disappointment. Chase Wilcox, professional vulcanologist, and Nicole Ballard, artist and dancer, meet on the island of Hawaii. Each has a tragic ""secret"" from the past that must be overcome before they can acknowledge their love. There is a great deal of drumming (Chase) and dancing to Tahitian music (Nicole aka Pele, goddess of fire) that is just too silly for words. The best parts are the descriptions of the island, the little bit that you get about its native population, and the fascinating material included on volcanoes. Ms. Lowell does her research. Save your money for the next book about the Donovan clan, or go back and buy one of Ms. Lowell's older works written as Ann Maxwell, such as ""Tell Me No Lies."""
1,Bad equipment,"Out of the box the scanner was broken, it would not scan.I will be looking for another company that makes scanners."
1,It sounded great!,"We thought this sounded so neat that we bought many of them to give as gifts. When we opened the first one, it was so tighly shut that we broke our nails trying to open it. After a few tries we decided they would not work for us. I have to say, that we wrote to return them right away. Amazon makes returns pretty easy and we were reimbursed in quick time."
1,Do NOT buy Lipper,"We bought a Lipper brand table 1.5 years ago and it has never been sturdy. Although the wood is of good quality, the construction is not. The holes were not drilled properly and the legs are all cock-eyed and constantly move around. We have one little girl and she is not rough with furniture. We are already looking for another table. I HIGHLY recommend buying another brand. I would put zero stars if that was an option."
1,Terrible Product,"Do not buy this product. I assembled the chairs first, and they were fine. The table is impossible. The screws are too tight and do not go all the way in. My husband and I made an effort to follow their instructions and tighten the screws with a Phillips scredriver after putting liquid soap on the screws, etc. but to no avail. We gave up thinking we will try later. But as we straightened out the wobbly table, we saw a deep crack (either already there or created due to our efforts to screw in the legs) that started from the edge, and ran a quarter of the way through the diameter of the table. Junk."
1,"Not worth the cost, even on sale","Hello,I purchase this set during a Lightning Deal for $100, and after reading great reviews of the product on multiple websites. However, I regret buying it because it is not well made at all. When putting the table together, some of the Philip screws heads were stripped and I had to hammer screw bits into the heads in order to get enough contact to finish the job. The chairs were less troublesome, however, the back slats were loose in place because they were a couple of millimeters too short. Both the table and chairs wobble as well. My advise is to look for another set without any negative comments, regardless of the star rating.Regards,Ian"
1,Disappointed,"I ordered this table and two chairs, along with two matching chairs under a separate stock number. Of the total of four chairs, three were fine. The forth had a factory misassembly. The parts could not be assembled as delivered. I had to remove the under-the-seat brace, drill new holes and reattach the under-seat brace to get the leg assembly to fit the chair properly and to properly align the predrilled screw holes in the leg assembly. The table assembled OK, but the top had a split in it. I had to repair the split, sand and refinish the table top prior to giving to my grandson. This table/chair combo is of very poor quality."
1,broke rather quickly,This table lasted maybe two years. The screw on the table stripped and that was it. I was able to tighten it once before they stripped which means they are now useless.
1,Need a Crowbar to open it,"It's a great concept, and I can't say much for it's functions but the bottle opener is good I used it and it worked well. However one major flaw is, it's WW3 just to open the darn thing! I feel I need a pair of pliers just to get the darn things open, and if you dont have nails like me you are in some serious trouble. Like I said great concept, and looks great but as for useability I feel it is almost useless for the difficulty to open it."
1,Lots of Party themes but a little outdated.,"I was disappointed in this book because I love Family Fun Magazine. It was more for the mom who is looking for an easy birthday theme and doesn't know where to start. Great for the younger years when the kids really don't care how elaborate the party is but by age 7 I think the ideas in this book would just be too basic. You can find most of these themes in any party store so I think it is outdated since parties have become an ""event"" nowadays."
1,predrilled holes,My son & nephew both received one of these sets as a gift. In both cases the pre drilled holes were too large so that the screws could not be tightened.
1,Was going give 4 stars but...,"Received this set and took everything out of the box and noticed the chair was broken in half. That was fine, we just sent it back and Amazon overnighted a replacement. Took everything out of the new box and was happy to see everything was ok. Got the 2 chairs put together so very easily, then started on the table. The screws split the wood on the second leg we tried to attach. There was no salvaging it. It was completely wrecked. So we are giving up on this set. I was going to give it a 4 star rating because it seemed so very nice and also easy to put together, but after having to ship it back twice, this only gets one star. So dissapointing. Will be buying a cheaper little tikes plastic set that we don't have to assemble I guess. You can't buy anything good these days."
1,Too Complicated!,"This is a beautiful book with lots of color photographs, but it made me uncomfortable. It is a little too professional and too slick, and not at all the kind of parties that I would throw for my kids. I found the ideas and suggestions way too complex for the average mom to pull off. My time is limited and I can't spend hours on end preparing for each component of a birthday party. Plus, there were lots of ideas for decorating and setting the stage, but I would have liked more ideas for games and activites."
1,Obvious defect on table top.,This was very disappointing. Paid a lot for what I thought would be a good quality child's table only to be very disappointed. There was an obvious defect in the wood that ran down top of table.I would not recommend this product.
1,Very Dated Book,"You can tell this is a book written a number of years ago. Ms. Lowell may have ""updated"" some parts, but it is definitely a book from it's time. The dialog was so over the top that I skipped whole sections. Ms. Lowell has the unpleasant habit of having the so-called hero have a pet name for the heroine. This could be cute if handled well, but it gets to be so annoying. I wanted to tell him - she has a name and it's not Butterfly. Stick to Ms. Lowell's more recent attempts. They are quite good."
1,Skip this one!,"Not one of Ms. Lowell's better efforts. I generously gave it 2 stars because it was slightly better than DESERT RAIN, which I generously gave 1 star). If you're like me, you'll find yourself scanning through the pages just to get to the end. Neither of the main characters are memorable or even believable. Some readers may like the descriptions of Hawaii's flora and volcanic history--but not me. It could not make up for the poor story line and weak characters. BEAUTIFUL DREAMER is a much, much better book. Try that one and give this one a bye."
1,disappointing,"I wish I had waited for the paperback. Really a poor example of Mrs. Maxwell's work. She is one of my favorite authors but this book is obviously one of her first efforts and not worth ""reworking"". Not much plot and a lot of sex."
1,SAD SAD SAD,"THE LEMON LABLE GOT A HOLD OF THE GREAT ALBUM AND MADE A MESS OUT OF IT. THEY THE 'LEMON LABLE' RECORDED THIS OFF A LP AND THEY CALL IT A REMASTER.SAVE YOUR MONEY! IF YOU ARE A POCO FAN, WRITE LEMON AND COMPLAIN."
1,Dr. Otto,For a Jim Varny film I found this to be very slow and did not keep my attenzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz.
1,Zipper Broke before school year was over,"Very pretty and nice, but zipper broke before the school year was over, so I wasn't able to use it for the entire school year. For the price I paid, I was hoping it would last at least a whole school year."
1,Not very practicable in spite of the title,"This is not a very useful book, in my opinion. The puzzles can be interesting for some people, but I found it quite dull. Some people may find them clever and 'neat' but I don't think most people will be pleased by the book. Some of the puzzles are 'old hat' to anyone who has done much reading on finance eg option pricing."
1,Of limited interest,"The puzzles in the book are of little practical value. If you have much previous reading in finance you would already be aware of these issues.You may also find the tone of the book annoying - ""look how clever I am"".Like most of finance, the math is not very interesting in itself, nor is it very accurate in describing the real world e.g. the Black-Scholes option pricing model.If you are reasonably good at math and know little or nothing about finance you may enjoy the book. Otherwise a standard text on investment management would be better."
1,"Great Series, terrible digital access","WB really needs to get it together. Their exclusive ""flixster app"" is total nonsense. This disc does not come with any ability to add the digital copy to itunes. They have decided that it is better for me to have digital content in multiple places...not a fan! I will never buy any other titles in this way, until ultraviolet and flixster allow me to claim it in itunes."
1,Beware,"This release is a CD-R, not a factory made CD. Deceptively, this is not disclosed anywhere in the product description or in the CD booklet. Since CD-Rs have a rather shorter lifespan than ""real"" CDs, it would have been decent to reveal the truth upfront. Basically, it's a homemade bootleg.Otherwise, the music and performances are outstanding."
1,a HUGE was of time,"This book outlines a diet that is a huge waste of time. The diet is impractical, the sections are poorly organized, the shopping lists are worthless (they omit many items needed for meals) and the premise of the whole process is based on pseudo-science and new age mumbo-jumbo. You'd be better off going on a strict, vegan, no protein, no carb diet for three weeks than trying to adhere to this crazy diet! The weight loss experienced by this diet would be due solely to the lower caloric intake and have nothing to do a some 'magical' combinations of 'problem foods' that you have avoided. Of course, my 'problem food' combination is a big mac, french fries and a milkshake -- so maybe it does help???"
1,"Good Idea, but short on substance","The basic idea of the book is contained in the title. Jazz phrasing should move forward toward the strong harmonic beats. The substance of the book is pretty much one example over and over. It is also rather chatty, i.e. ""When me and Dizz were playing at the ... etc. etc."". A far better choice is ""Connecting Chords with Linear Harmony"" by Bert Ligon. Also David Baker's ""How to play bebop"" series covers in depth some of the ideas ""Galps"" just touches on."
1,cheap toy,"This toy is made of cheap thin plastic and the string to affix it to your child's arm broke the same day we got it. If you could buy this toy in a dollar store, it would be fine. That is about all it is worth. Don't waste your money"
1,tedious,"This book provides the tedious details of an event of minor importance in order to show the inner workings of the Ching system of administration. Though it illustrates some of the simmering nationalism that was to influence later attempts to end the Manchu rule, I was disappointed by overwhelming amount of tedious detail that breaks apart the narrative and makes the book as a whole slow-paced. Some interesting insights are presented, but it is definitely NOT a pleasure to read."
1,Think Twice before buying LaCie,"I purchased a LaCie NAS drive approximately 18 months ago. The product had several shortcomings including the inability to back-up files that did not meet its highly restrictive file name rules. This turned out to be nearly half of my files. The documentation with the product was terrible. Now, 18 months later, the drive ceases to function and LaCie refuses to repair it because:""Unfortunately, LaCie does not handle out-of-warranty repairs. It isusually not cost effective to repair electronics since the price for newdrives has come down and the capacity has increased"".I can understand a response like this on a $99 product but not a $600 NAS. My advice: Don't buy LaCie!"
1,need Windows XP Professional for this drive,"Great drive, but you need to have XP Pro in order to use it. You need to turn off Windows Simple File Sharing which can ONLY be done with XP Pro.Note that I called LaCie tech support and they were amazing and tried to help me the best they could. They even found out a work around to solve this issue but no satifacti=ory for most people."
1,Read customer reviews before you buy,"If you think you're gonna hook this guy to your network, map it and you're done... oooh boy what a dissapointment!This is merely a glorified USB hard disk (it looks good though). It's FAT32 preformatted, so any files larger than 4GB (such as my AVI and MPEG files) mean trouble. Add to that file naming and file sharing and much more...At such a price, do yourself and your wallet a favor and don't bother."
1,Too expensive!,"I ordered this because we love California Baby and we love the ""Calming"" shampoo and body wash the most. I would give the product 5 stars, normally. BUT, I found a ***19oz*** bottle at Target for only $19.19 (including tax)! I paid nearly $4.50 MORE for a bottle with 1.5 ounces LESS! I have to suck up this error because Amazon would charge me to return it, and it's obviously not worth the $5 shipping to get my money back."
1,Live.........!,"Buyer Beware, This is a live Version with bad recording as well.muffled, high Bass, and much audience Noise."
1,Another uninspired one,"I'm sorry to say I bought this one based on the positive reviews here. I don't know what these guys ware smoking but I'd like some of it if it makes one think this is great.Nobody ever pulled off the one man band thing and made it sound interesting and this is no exception. I don't know if this material is so uninspired because he knew he wouldn't be recording it with a band, and a producer, or whether it just sounds that way as a result. But it's another dog nonetheless."
1,awful,"not a good effort at all, paul's getting weird again, the song ''jingle'' is by far worst song i've ever heard"
1,Ouch,"I'm sorry - I love PW as much as anyone out there, but aside from a few good tracks (My Dad, Lookin' out in Heaven, As Far As I Know, Gun Shy), this album is really quite atrocious.Poor writing ($100 Groom), unfunny/lame jokes (Jingle), and painfully poor vocals (Breathe Some New Life) just kill this album... that last song really makes me cringe.It may have been recorded in the same manner as Stereo/Mono, Come Feel Me Tremble & Dean Man Shake - but this one is lacking in both material and (from what I can tell) interest on Paul's part.Hardly ""the bomb"" we were all anticipating."
1,Swiss Tech -- not so much...,"The Swiss Tech Utili-key 6-in-1 was a promising little tool, offering a sleek design with high utility-- until you actually try to use it. I was displeased with the need to pry it open with my fingernails & felt a lot of apprehension each time I did so, wondering when my thumb might slip on the straight edge. It opens up 180 degrees, locking but only jusst: apply too much pressure & it will fold up, making useless the leverage its length is supposed to provide. Popping a bottle cap off is a bit of a chore because it's so thin, even after trying it out on several bottles of, er, cream soda. The straight and serrated blades are sharp, and cut great, but the handling is so awkward as to make them more dangerous than useful. Finally, I find it inconvenient that my keys have to dangle while i pry the tool open, which means I'll be picking them up off the ground every time i want to use this tool.It was a cute idea, but cute won't cut it..."
1,They can't all be winners,"While I consider Westerberg to be an incredibly talented performer and songwriter, his solo contributions have really been hit or miss for me. Folker is no exception. There just doesn't seem to be much there. Where 14 Songs, Stereo, and Eventually all had some standout moments, this album seems to hum along without much ambition."
1,Beware of Re-Hashing,"I have been a Paul Westerberg/Replacements fan going on 16 years. I have followed Paul's solo career, and have all of his CD's. On this album, it appears that Paul really, really needs to start working with a producer again. There are a couple of gems on this one, notably ""Folker,"" and ""My Dad."" However, it seems that Paul is re-hashing some of his earlier solo material. I never thought I would say that about Paul's solo career, but alas, there it is. If you like Paul's solo outings, I reccommend the Grandpaboy release ""Mono."""
1,What a long way down,"Oh my, in pains me to have to say that this album is awful. I've loved Paul and The Replacements so long, how painful. Was he drunk while recording this? Where's the good songwriting we've come to expect. Only a very few highlights. Sad."
1,Ho hum,"The problem with this CD is not the production--thankfully, Paul is no Peter Gabriel--it's the songs. If you were to compile a list of Paul's 50 best songs, none of these would be on it.Save your money for the tour or spend it on the new Tommy Stinson."
1,PATHETIC! INCREDIBLY BORING!,"This is one of the most BORING so-called 'horror' movies I've seen in quite a while! There's maybe 5 minutes of action in the entire movie! There is however LOTS of jabbering about crap that nobody but the writer cares about. This thing was clearly made by people who want to do DRAMA, not horror, however the low-budget drama world doesn't have as many fans as the low budget horror genre does, so they stick a few cheesy violent scenes in just so they can sell it to horror fans. Avoid like the plague if you value the time it takes to watch this awful mess."
1,confused political polemic disguised as time travel,"I'm a fan of time travel from way back. Finney's novels, Matheson's Bid Time Return, Allen Appel's books, and others. Time on My Hands starts well, but bludgeons you with anti-Reagan propaganda. I'm not the former president's biggest supporter, but I thought Forrest Gump had wandered into the plot. The time travel aspects are really confused, as Delacorte's understanding of time travel has several holes in logic. The ending is a complete cop-out, almost as if he had to meet a deadline. Its questions on the hazards of time travel affecting one's existence aren't well-thought out at all. You'd be better off re-reading Time and Again, or something like Ken Grimwood's Replay, Darryl Brock's If I Never Get Back, or even Kinsella's Shoeless Joe, which has elements of time travel. But skip this one and travel to anything else."
1,Never slices the bagel evenly,"I've had mine for a few weeks and have probably cut at least a dozen bagels so far. This device *never* cuts the bagel evenly. Instead I end up with two ""halves"" where one end of the bagel is 1/2"" thick and the other end is about 1"" thick. This means the bagels will never toast evenly in the toaster. It does a good job of slicing but without being able to slice the bagel in half this product is basically worthless.The huge number of positive reviews that seem to never mention this fact lead me to believe that many of them are bogus."
1,Ok background music,"This was an okay mix of various genres of music, but I get the impression that the assignment of X band to X vampire clan was purely arbitrary. The lyrical quotes attributed to various clans sometimes made little, if any, sense. Some matched better than others, but this album would have served the White Wolf bunch better if they'd had more bands/songs to choose from. Seems like White Wolf is in bed with some obscure bands & trying to cross-promote. Which is fine, but a little limiting on the musical choices."
1,Not true to the Crusty series,I've been a big fan of the Crusty Demons of Dirt series since the beginning back in the mid-90s. This volume is just a documentary of their Australia efforts. It's a really weak effort and not recommeded. A waste of money in my opinion.
1,I have the facts and I'm voting NO!!!,"I've hated a lot of the Deathcab for Cutie C.D.'s I've heard, but none of them so much as this one. This album can be criticized mainly for its recurrent melody styles, vocal rhythms that just don't work, and the fact that most of the songs are dull and mellow. Although this band has exceedingly well written lyrics, it is difficult to pay too much attention to them since the rhythms accompanying them are so uninteresting. The only song I was able to tolerate, let alone like was ""Title Track"". This tune has a cool drum beat, a catchy rhythm, and the typical good set of lyrics. While Deathcab for Cutie fans would probably eat this album up, I simply can't stand it. Also, there are only ten songs on it, a rather unsatisfactory amount of tracks in my view. I would give this album one star, though it is somewhat useful in curing insomnia."
1,What are you people talking about?,"This is bad, boring, stupid, boring, pointless, boring, over-praised, boring, and boring music.Will you never learn? (depressed sigh)"
1,Beating a Dead Horse,"This has all been done before... albeit much, much better. ""We Have The Facts And We're Voting Yes"" is the epitome of dull, lifeless, uninspired indie-rock. It sounds like Built To Spill stripped of any talent, soul, or personality. To listen to it brings to mind a roundish grey blob, sitting in an abandoned parking garage, emitting a high-ptiched squeal; the effect of which is similar to that of pushing a blunt iron rod through your sinuses and giving it a good crank or two. Bleh."
1,Disappointed,Smells as if it where watered down. Dries down to almost nothing. Wasted money. Doesnt' smell like the Albert Nipon I have at home.
1,disappointing,"This book is clearly a compendium of articles and as such is poorly organized and repeatitive. The articles themselves are fine, but they don't work in book form. The author spends a great deal of time on his ""magic"", home-brewed ammunition and custom-built revolvers, which simply aren't a viable alternative for most people. It is certainly worth the read, but it is disappointing because I'm sure that there's much more to learn from Cirillo than is presented here."
1,Developer's eye view of Managing Software Maniacs,After reading this book there was only one thing I took away with me. Ken Whitaker's ideal priority list for making decisions. His discussion on the why is most illuminating.The rest of the book is somewhat wooly. I felt that for my needs (looking to move to technical lead) Rapid Development was a more worthwhile read.
1,Get what you pay for,Always wondered how the pump worked. In these shoes its all or none. Unfortunately the all is way too tight for me. Not a very comfy shoe.
1,Very little actual content,"Very actual little content, I would not recommend any one actually buying this book. The one or two gunfights described though were interesting."
1,You can't have seriously liked this.,"The journalist who wrote this book infused her own feelings and opinions into every word. Bollywood Boy is not an objective work, nor is the writer's voice interesting or accurate enough to allow her bias go unnoticed. She fell in love with her main character and selfishly and rather dully used everyone she came in contact with - including us, the readers - to get where she wanted to be. It would have been great if this book were really about Hrithik Roshan, or the Hindi film industry, or the Indian people. It was just about Justine's crush. The publisher obviously doesn't know the subject matter well enough to know that there is little substance here, but did he have to, to at least recognize bad, self-indulgent writing? The arena remains clear for someone else to actually write about Roshan."
1,NOT WORTH MENTIONING.....................BUT WILL.,"Not much to say.............both flicks did not live up to much other than ""Chosen Survivors"" was made in the early 70' s where ALL-STAR CASTS was all the rage like ""Airport-70-times over disasters"". It was just boring. The other movie ""The Earth Dies Screaming"" was better as just a movie poster than watching the movie. The aliens could have been shown more for entertainment purposes as well as more victims.JOE BOB SAY'S..........DON' T CHECK IT OUT!"
1,Don't Buy,"This book is the second of the two book set. You can also purchase the set as a single edition, however that would be a mistake. I've used this text in class and besides being heavily mistake ridden, as others noticed, its extremely unhelpful for Quantum and Thermo beginners. Poor choice."
1,I am a bit dissapointed.,"ERm, I'm not under thirteen I just don't feel like creating an acount, seemed deep. Anyways, when I turned it on, i heard some slow stuff. So I thought maybe it was a slump, so I turned it to the next, then the next, all slow! I'm the type of person who like the 'lets revolt against authotiry and scream about how pissed we are' type person. I mean, this stuff is good if you like quiet. Good lyrics, /really/ good, but also quite slow. I want my money back though.... =/"
1,you get only one,"Well, they do not send you ""handkerchiefS"", they send you ONE handkerchief, for the wonderful price of $4.00 + $6.99 shipping and handling. $10.99 for one handkerchief. Need I say more?"
1,A.K.A. 'Trauma',"This is another name for a movie called 'Trauma'; Directed by Albert Negrin, featuring Fabio Testi (not to be confused with the Dario Argento movie of the same name). Since it has been a while since I have seen this movie, I will give the teaser from a movie review guide: ' A private girls' school is located close to a village where murders are occuring and where rich men's fantasies are catered to by the populace.' I do not remember too much about the movie other that the plot dragged and when the person responsible for the attrocities was revealed, it seemed just like a random way to end the movie. My viewing of this movie was from a VHS copy. I do not know the quality of the DVD, but, considering that it is from Saturn, I do not have high hopes.-Bob"
1,The Worst Print With The Worst Sound,"This copy of ""Virgin Terror"" by Saturn Productions is the worst DVD I have ever bought. It's obviously a bad copy made from a VHS tape that was made from a beaten-up print and it has the worst sound I have ever come across. I challenge anyone to figure out what the actors are saying. This DVD should have come with subtitles, because unless you are an expert lip-reader and are fluent in Italian or French or German you will not understand a single word spoken by the badly dubbed actors. If you pay more than 50 cents for this DVD, you're getting ripped off. Beware of the cover with the knife for the letter ""T"" and gravestones in the background."
1,"Same Product - Multiple Names , different Prices","Atomic Structure & the Periodic Table (2004) = The Periodic Table : PROPERTIES OF COMPOUNDS = Properties of compounds ---> all are One and the same, but the prices are Different"
1,Meh,"This book was required for a Spectroscopy class I just took. The explanations were OK, but they were way too basic for the class and didn't go into enough detail. I ended up buying Bernath's Spectra of Atoms and Molecules midway through the term, which provides a much much better (more rigorous) explanation of rotational, vibrational, and Raman spectroscopy. I think the reason that Engel was required for my class was because it also covers NMR, which Bernath does not. A pity."
1,Weak magnet = disappointment. At least it looks good.,"Pros:-Looks goodCons:-Weak magnet. When you try to rotate the disc from clean to dirty, the whole thing spins-Like any stainless steel product, it tends to get smudged with finger printsI would not buy this product again. It does not meet expectations."
1,Does not turn,"The disc and the magnet in the back are fastened together so tightly that it's impossible to turn the disc and not the magnet. Consequently, the magnet can, and does scratch the front of the dishwasher. There are better, and cheaper, alternatives."
1,Can't support even its own weight,"Do not buy this product! The magnet is so weak that it can barely hold itself on the dishwasher. There's no way you can then spin between Dirty and Clean. Yes, it's nicely made, but it doesn't work. I have a bunch of cheap, thin refrigerator magnets that do a much better job sticking to the dishwasher so I know it's not an issue with the quality of sheet metal in the appliance. It held lots of other magnets during my testing - just not this one. I can't fathom how the other positive reviews got in here. Unless you think my purchase is a freak manufacturing flaw that QA didn't catch, do not choose this product! It's just throwing your money away."
1,Defective item?,"after making a few good copies it starting leaving a single scratched-off line in random areas of the printed page. not sure what the problem is from. noted that they have begun providing directions in picture format instead of the printed word, at least one of the ""simple"" picture directions is not intelligible, not sure if it means to turn something or what, seems silly not to have a short written explanation."
1,you can do better,"the guitar is not very good quality, the strap bolt on the top of the guitar broke after only a few months of use. the bag ripped at the seam as well. you would be better off buying used at a pawn shop"
1,"Truly Awful Instrument,.....THE ABSOLUTE WORST after 45 years of guitar purchases","You can buy quite a few nice beginner, or pro closeouts for $100.00 This bass, is not one.This instrument had the pups fall out, volume knob wedged tight so as not to turn, screws forced into,the pickguard, diagonally, razor frets, more buzzing than a honey farm, muddy sound, tons of black overspray on 9 zebra stripes, rusty strings, out of tune by the second song, could not hold a tune in a barrell.True JunkChinese Junk(boatload of headaches)Radically Smokin' wall hanging, thoughIf you purchase this,You will needSeriousProfessionalTreatmentBad guitarBOOHISSTerrible"
1,You get what you pay for,"So, like everyone who purchases this bass, I just wanted a cheap one for fun.That being said, the first one that I got literally sliced my hand up. I only noticed when there was blood all over the strings. The frets were left untrimmed and sticking out of the bottom of the neck. As I played the bass, they sliced up my hands like razor blades.So, I contacted Austin Bazaar and they sent me a new one, which is fine.Like the other reviews say, this is a cheap bass, and certainly not professional, but it works.Just make sure to check your frets when you receive yours so you don't cut up your hands..."
1,People need to write their own songs,"I can't believe this song was as popular as it was. Remakes of classic songs are RARELY better than the original, and this is definitely no exception. Jackson's version was the original, and far superior to Alien Ant Farm's. For me, a band must write their own songs before they get any respect from me. Did Alien Ant Farm even make any other songs? Save yourself the money on this one and go buy Jackson's ""Bad,"" which has not only this song but many other classic hits, written by him."
1,Better than what? I guess some jiggy rapper,Built to Spill with a keyboard before they started doing the same thing. Umm...pretty alright for snoozing but hell the band was young and impressionable.
1,Agree with others about short print life,"I agree with everyone else who has put in a negative word about the lifespan of the Canon 104. I work in a fairly busy office and we just purchased a Canon laser all-in-one a month ago, and when we started noticing having to change the toner every week (!!!!!), I started keeping track of copy/print counts. Even at the lowest density settings, the most we've ever been able to get out of 1 cartridge was 1,300 prints -- a far cry from the advertised 2,000 prints. We are at the point that we will probably return the printer and go with something else. The only reason I gave it an extra star from rock-bottom is the ease of use (hey, if we have to change the cartridge weekly, might as well make it easy to do!)."
1,Belongs in the Office of Redundancy Office,"I pray that Jim Cirillo was a better cop than he is an author. There are a few good ""nuggets of knowledge"" here and there throughout the book but if the repeated information was left out, the book would be half it's size. I may give his other books a try but spend your money else where rather than on this one."
1,never got it,I ordered this 1 month ago and never got it but paid for it. What happened??????? Trina Please email me back and let me know how to get a refund
1,What do you expect?,This sucks. I had a feeling it would. Everyone is ugly and can't play their guitars.
1,HORRIBLE!,"The author of this book clearly does not have children. The stories are inappropriate for young children. Jack and the Beanstalk is the worst re-telling I have ever seen. It teaches children to steal, to lie and to not only kill the giant, who was minding his own business, but to take all his belongings after he's dead. Jack's mother actually praises Jack for killing the Giant and taking is things. Unbelievable!"
1,Major Suckage,"Normally children's books don't annoy me. I can go for hours listening to Elmo, or watching Dora, and not blink. I can read the books, play the games and basically do all the things a mother needs to do to raise well adjusted children.This, however, sucks. The only reason it got one star at all is because it does introduce more than just your standard northern European fairy tales. The illustrations, story adaptations themselves, and the bind of the book are all horrible.This book wasn't even worth checking out from the library."
1,HORRIBLE!,"It ended up damaging my printer! My humble request is to buy a toner directly from canon even if it costs a little more! At least, your printer will be saved."
1,devil in the details,No one has mentioned that one must treat the water for four hours to get the sterility touted. That's a long time to wait for a drink!
1,"Yuck, Good For Awhile But Then DOWN","Okay, it started off funny and witty. Then it started to go down. Then Team Rocket never even came close to winning. Okay NOW MOVE ON. Get The Slayers, or Ranma 1/2 if you want some comedy. None of this garbage. Unless you have a kid then get it. But not if you are over 13. God listen to me. This is like Sailor Moon for boys. YUCK!!!"
1,Disappointly low yield,"I purchased the Canon brand rather than one of the compatible brands to refill my ink cartridge. I regret to say that it ran out of ink surprisingly quickly. No, I didn't ""count"" the amount of pages that it printed, but I will say that I only went through apprxomately TWO 500 page packages before it started beeping and saying that I needed to charge the cartridge. Sure, shaking the cartridge got me through a few more weeks. Still, not what you expect when you pay so much money for an ink cartridge."
1,Company is misleadingly selling products incorrectly.,"Contacted the vendor for this product, informed them that they were selling an individual board under the listing for the 10-pack bulk item number. Their customer service was unhelpful and didn't seem to understand what I was trying to do, by helping them and telling them about their mistake. If you are thinking this is the 10-pack be wary; they told me this was for the single board, not the bulk pack."
1,chatty story about being a cop in NY,"I wanted a book about how a cop trains to shoot. This isn't it. Borrow a copy, it is a good quick and fun read. Stories and anecdotes about being a special operations stake out cop in New York City. Now there is value in such tales, to recruit young cops maybe. But i wanted to read about tactics, training, how to learn to use a pistol. What i got was a lot about his bullets, his gunsmithing, his shooting. But nothing i could use. He is certainly an interesting guy, but i wouldnt want to take a concealed weapon class from him based on this book. I'd rather learn how to shoot like him, then to hear about how he shot some really bad guys.Get Suarez's Tactical Pistol set instead."
1,Gnosticism without knowledge for me,"This book is for professionals!! I was hoping for a better understanding of the influence of gnosticism on modern thought, especially New Age thinking. Instead this is an introductory volume for a large number of highly detailed, thoroughly researched future books. In the intro. the author spends most of his time justifying the authors he will site in future volumes. There is little explanation of the intellectual roots of gnosticism or how it plays out in the current stream of culture. I have tried to stay with the reading but it has not been fun or truly enlightening. Read this if you are going to teach a Ph.D. course."
1,Waste of $$$!!!,"Don't bother. The first 50 pags are filled with nothing but propaganda on how his ""patented"" bullet is the only round worth anything. The ensuing pages have a ""hey look how great I am"" feel to them. Anytime he comes close to making a valid point or highlighting something useful he instantly takes away from it by adding some ego inflated comment on how it was all his doing."
1,Boooorrrrriiiinnng,"Jim Cirillo is so full of himself that it isn't even funny. This book is poorly written. He repeats himself -- I swear you get the account of his first shootout no less than three times. His arrogance is overwhelming, even on the off chance it may be deserved. There is some useful information in this book about the physiology of bullet damage and the importance of drilling for those involved in high-stress shootouts. But I was left with the impression that this guy enjoyed killing just a little too much. Frankly, I don't know whether to be relieved he's no longer on the force or scared s--tless that he's out there packing with no supervision."
1,"Jackie Chan's Second Strike, where is Jackie!",I bought this movie and watched it and all it had about Jackie Chan was a interview. I had it returned and got the ten times better movie Supercop. Don't be fooled.
1,"Warning this is not a Jackie Chan movie,","The original title of this movie was Project S, made in the early nineties and starring Michelle Yeoh. Jackie Chan only has a small cameo as a drag queen ! Its clear that Jackie Chan fans are being exploited by video distributors and I for one find this kind of abuse offensive. If you would like any advice on other Jackie Chan movies then e-mail me at peterharrop@freenet.co.uk"
1,"SUCK,SUCK AND SUCK SOME MORE",This movie suck so bad i wish I had rent it before I bought it. OK first of all they put jackie on the front of the box knowing he is not in the movie that made me so mad. Second the movie had less fighting than any martial art movie i have ever seen about two fighting scene to be exact.WARNING: DO NOT PURCHASE ARE RENT THIS VIDEO IT SUCK IT'S THE WORST MARTAIL ART MOVIE.
1,No Jackie,"If you love Jackie Chan movies then this one is certainly not for you. Jackie Chan is not even in the actual movie. Sure, in the beginning you see him doing some kind of interview but thats about it. The movie is great if you like sapy revenge stories but the false picture of Jackie on the cover is a false lead. I thought that it was a sequal to first strike but this was not what I had expected. So save your money and buy First Strike instead."
1,Where's Jackie Chan?,"Don't be decieved by the title of this movie. Although it features a fairly lame interview with Jackie Chan at the beginning, the movie itself does not appear to feature him except in the title. I found it to be a terrible waste of time to watch this. If you want a Jackie movie, don't watch this. If you want a good martial arts movie, don't watch this. If you want a good paperweight, I think that it is possible to find a better one."
1,The film has nothing to do with Jackie chan!!,"This video is not worth buying as Jackie Chan is not in it! He is in the music video at the end and there is a small interview with him, thats all folks...... This video is a waste of time and money!!"
1,Piece of garbage.,Way small on anyone's hands and they tore almost immediately. I'm happy I only had to use these once since they literally fell apart when I took them off.
1,They Sucked,"They began to dis-sew on the first wear .. also, they stank of cheap plastic, it was gross. They fit to large on my hands. So disappointing."
1,Bad advice from a bad cop,"Cirillo is a perfect example of a dirt bag that would be behind bars if he didn't have a badge. His boring and repetitive accounts of his actions on the NYPD hit squad called the stakeout squad are doubtlessly embellished to sate his inflated ego. This makes for a difficult read. Then after attempting to impress the reader with the size of his you-know-whats, he tells us the we, the simple citizens of the USA do not deserve to be able to defend ourselves with firearms from the thugs out there. Frankly, I'm glad he's retired, because bloodthirsty cops like him made it difficult for the rest of us."
1,Ludicrous...!!!!!,"Only in America. The notion that some people find this kind of stuff interesting says a lot about them. That it found a publisher speaks volumes about a culture that encourages everyday citizens to pack heat...and ""protect"" themselves. In trying to make his vile case, Crillo indadvertently shows why we have more to fear from the pinhead next store with his or her shiny new Smith & Wesson than we do from all the so-called street scum. I support gun rights but let's be clear: this kind of nonsense will do more to sink the second amendment than any form of controls. No wonder the rest of the world finds the American preoccupation with firearms both idiotic...and inexplicable. Who can explain this? It makes no sense."
1,Little Value for your Money,"I purchased this product for my classroom use. This toner was intended for classroom emergencies in case my school is unable to complete my copies on time. With a deal like this, I thought I was getting value for my money. The two toners should have given 10,000 regular prints/copies. To my amazement, the first toner printed less than 700 student worksheets while the second toner printed just one packet of 8.5x11 (500 sheets). This was more than robbery and my money should have been returned. I would advise prospective buyers to beware of wolves in sheep's clothing. Cheap but no good"
1,toothless old man,"this record is like a toothless, senile old man: it's kinda cute at first, but the more you listen to its meanderings, the more you want it to shut up and go away. the songs have absolutely no drive, or teeth, and they sound like they were recorded in an underwater hallway. how they could be compared to built to spill or modest mouse is beyond comprehension. those bands rock. this one just sort of stumbles around in the dark, forgetting to turn on its instruments."
1,Very poor quality and defective.........Muy mala calidad y defectuoso,"Entrust this bass guitar for my brother, who wants to learn to play bass, but when tested, failed the fourth string, then I had to return it.Besides the poor quality of the product.Encargue este bajo electrico para mi hermano, que quiere aprender a tocar el bajo, pero al probarlo, fallaba la cuarta cuerda, entonces tube que regresarlo."
1,Disappointment!!!,I usually love Danielle Steel's novels. This book was a real disappointment. She was trying to be humorous but I was not amused. Try again Danielle! Read The Ghost instead!!
1,junk,This bass was the biggest piece of crap two of the same strings came on it so they just threw the other one in the box tuning pegs didn't work cheap plastic had to order new ones one of the pick up didn't work had to glue it shipped in a very unsafe box would not buy again would not buy if I were you this is not even child worthy to learn on can get a used bass at guitar for cheaper that's better quality
1,metopod .,pokemon is my favrite show .I HAVE 15 VIDEOS! metopod is olny in this video for a little while. but pikachu and caterpie are in the video a lot . misty hates carrots pepors and bugs (like caterpie) . she is the meanist girl ive ever seen.
1,Stratocabbagius..........A listening extravaganzagus.,"Up until 2005, I had never heard of Stratovarius. After listening to Visions, I now know why. What is this album? I went back and listened again. I do feel that Visions is their best work up to date, including their newer releases. However, there best work is cabbage. I would describe Visions as video game soundtrack material where the game producers are trying to Mock the 1980's cheesy metal scene. It's hilarious, actually. The Track ""Forever Free"" made me laugh out loud.I think it's the vocals that turn this album into something I can't take seriously. Every time I hear that voice, I bust up. Total Cheese Whiz. Where's that hotdog?The most potential with Visions are the drums and the beats. The rhythms are quite good and really involve you.Statovarius? No.Next question."
1,blech! what a weak attempt at metal,"If you're a fan of Helloween, Blind Guardian, Gamma Ray, Grave Digger, Rhapsody etc, then this band isn't for you. This is pop metal with absolutely no catchy melodies and uninspired, imitative playing. Guitarist Tolkki is a sad Yngwie Malmsteen clone. This is the second album i've tried from this band, both exceedingly weak. No more!"
1,STRATOBOMB,"Well, this band is boring. Utterly boring. Copying. Screaming. No punch. Clean. Polished. Cheesy.Jens Johansson was not a great addition, it's enough to see some performances of him live with Yngwie Malmsteen. The guy is a session musician, he goes wherever he get paid more.The rest of the band is tasteless and without any real ""nager"" in their instruments, the should call this style ""CLEAN AND SAFE EUROPEAN POWER METAL"". There's no edge. No guts."
1,Underwhelming visit to Pratchett's Discworld,"I'm not giving this a lukewarm review because it's shabby or poorly written or otherwise sub-par, only because it simply didn't turn out to be my taste. ""Thief of Time"" consists of vignette after vignette and conversation after conversation on the nature of time, humanity, and the absurdities of life, all done with a humorous Monty Python-esque and Douglas Adams-ish bent. Individual scenes are somewhat amusing (I like Monty Python and Douglas Adams) but the whole thing sort of meanders and spins its wheels. I like momentum and story and progression, even with humorous satires, and this just sort of lost me time and again (no pun intended). But, as stated, strong fans of offbeat humor and satire may like this more than I did. I hear a lot of good things about Terry Pratchett, so I'll probably eventually try another of his ""Discworld"" titles (apparently it doesn't matter where you start). But I think I'll take a break for a while."
1,Garbage.,"Mr. Arostegui's book is poor at best. Prior to moving to my retirement assignment, I had the opportunity to spend ten years in the Special Operations community in an operational position. I have an above average knowledge of the system. Mr. Arostegui is out there flapping. Don't waste your time or money on his crap"
1,"Get the ""Episode"" album instead","A friend told me Strato rules, I got ""Visions"" on impulse, I thought it was ok but I didn't understand if I was missing something or not. Then after a while I picked up ""Episode"", now that truly is an awesome album, this one is so/so, something I won't bother listening to much any more."
1,Very disappointing.,It may take a great deal of skill to do what this author has done. He's taken an exciting and dynamic topic and produced a book which I read and regretted buying.
1,Here's an update,"Number of pre-Columbian horses found in the Americas (excluding those little tiny dog-sized ones from the Eocene)= 0Number of steel swords found in digs from periods prior to European colonization= 0Number of Native Americans found to have Jewish or Egyptian DNA prior to European colonization= 0Number of Cureloms and Cumoms located in the Americas= 0Number of archeological artifacts found from the great ancient city of Zarahemla= 0Number of written records recovered from the BOM periods that have any hebrew or egyptian characteristics= 0Number of peer reviewed studies of FARMS publications by reputable scientists who are not Mormon= 0Number of speeches by current and preceding prophets contradicting FARM's ""Limited Geography Theory""= 9,765Probability that the Book of Mormon is a literal transation of an ancient record of Native Americans= .00000000000000000001Got Faith?I welcome feedback on this and all reviews at wstrnlibwarrior@yahoo.com"
1,Another work by an armchair anthropologist,"This book is basicaly a rehash of Walter Raleigh's work. Whitehead, never having done any long-term fieldwork in Amazonia, offers little new insight to his readers. He gets away with this by theorizing, as postmodernists often do, from a distance (and using the hard work of others). This book, as so much of his other work, is a sign of the decay of anthropology in USA."
1,Got me wondering,"As a former member of the French Foreign Legion I happen to know Cuxon and he never was, as the author states, a member of CRAPs. I have to wonder therefore how much of the rest of the book was incorrect. Now it is possible that Cuxon was interviewed and lied but it's up to any responsible author to verify his information."
1,A Waste,This book seems to be based on hearsay.there is also a lot of technical mistakes.The story of the Namibian president being kidnapped wasthough out bysomeone that smoked something funny.I have stayed in that country my whole life and anybody that knows the country will know that the chances of that staying a secret is nil.A total waste of money.
1,Interesting Life made Less than Interesting,"There is no doubt that the man formally known as Harry Houdini led an interesting life. Sprinkled throughout this book are reminders of such. And yet, the authors' compilation of all this facts contributes to this book's lack in interest. Events and stories are not told chronologically, which wouldn't normally be a problem if there were some sort of other ordering system in place. Instead, things appear to be thrown in haphazardly, making it hard to keep track of the many characters in Houdini's life. Relevance to time and situation are lost with this mish-mash of information. Also, while the authors' attempt to humanize a biography is nice, their interposed dialogue proves distracting and a bit unbelievable. I would rather they had stuck to the facts, and presented them in some sort of order.The book is enjoyable only insomuch as Houdini's life was fascinating. Too bad the complete effects of this interesting life are lost within the puzzle of pages."
1,Study the Roots,"As someone who has studied sociology Feagin should know that the roots of racism predate the 14th century. Racism is a part of the human condition, in fact, Black Americans who state that people of color cant be racist, are, in actuality, planting the seed of racist thought. Feagin does not seem to understand that white's from Kant to Jefferson were actively questioning why certain races of people where seemingly culturally advanced and why others seemed to be stunted. Throughout history people have made war or dealt in other ways with different culturers, comparison naturally begins (race being a factor of many such comparisons)..example: in the 12th century Arab traders in the South of Africa noted that the inhabitants were dirty, drank to much and behaved in a lewd manner to their own women. Rightfully or not those traders formed a comparative opinion; much of what we now call racism is just that!"
1,A waste of money,Dialogue is poorly written. Storyline is exaggerated making the characters hardly believable. Main character's constant search for pity is annoying.
1,Wrong Discs Inside,"I ordered this product and found that it had 2 disc#1, 2 disc#2, one disc#3 and no disc 4 or 5. I contacted Amazon, who sent a replacement that had THE EXACT SAME PROBLEM. Likely a manufacturing error, but a huge one. I can't believe that it was a coincidence. They must have made this mistake on a lot of these sets."
1,annoying,this machine looks great and hides anywhere - but dont make it too hard to reach -it turns off by itself after 5 minutes.i see no way to change this - it seems built -in - unless of course i have a lemon. maybe i'll sit on the phone for 3 weeks to find out -it just goes on then hums awhile then goes off - basically doing nothing to help my dusty desk.a waste of money
1,I am alergic to this stupid cleaner,I mean what is the problem? I bought this to get rid of my alergies.But every time i use it it puts this very fine powder in the air.i am really pissed off
1,HORRIBLE...WHAT IS AMAZON THINKING,"My wife accidentally purchased the digital copy of season 5 Big Bang Theory thinking that she was buying the DVD's. No problem, right....WRONG. We have been trying to download the movies so that we can play them on our PC but have no idea where they were supposedly downloaded too. This site is horrible and leads me to ask the question, why is Amazon trying to compete with iTunes? They obviously have morons designing their site and this service!!!!It now shows that we have downloaded 1 of 2 copies, but we haven't downloaded anything. At this point I'm scared to select anything because it will tell me I've downloaded 2 of 2 and I will have spent nearly $40 on something that I will never see.AMAZON, get out of the business of downloading movies, music or anything else...you have been totally outclassed by the REAL PROFESSIONALS at APPLE!!!!! Your site is hard to navigate and that's putting it lightly."
1,Painfully unfunny,Anyone who finds this show funny has an abysmal sense of humor. Just absolutely terrible and unfunny in every possible way. I imagine this is what stupid people think a smart comedy is.
1,Strange pricing,"This is Bizare. As long as you have a DVD player that plays all country codes, you can buy this product from Amazon UK for under $26 including postage from the UK!!!! And that is full price in the UK without the $13.49 that Amazon .com says you are saving on their $31.49 retail price! I think there is a rip off going on with US DVD prices. As for the product, great series, just gets better."
1,Terrible Show.,"Poorly Written. Contrived. Not Funny. Excessive Laugh Track. Terrible, just terrible. An all-around awful show. Don't waste your life on this trash."
1,People like this?,"Saying ""Mario"" or ""Zelda"" in the punchline of a poorly written jest filled with several scientific terms that contain more then three syllables which are never used in their intended audiences typical environment, barley heard of a audience about to claw out their eyes from laughter is not funny or orginal.And yes I've been told I resemble Sheldon at my university, work and home.*laugh track*"
1,All around weak,"Constantly looking for music that is white boy reggae influenced. This is such a disappointment, it's lame to even say I heard it. Long Beach Dub Allstars were lousy enough, though sometimes they came through with a catchy song. This has nothing but copycat Sublime beats, an awful voice, and kindergarden lyrics. Try State Radio (lead singer of Dispatch) for some substance."
1,I don't like The Big Bang Theory.,The show is not funny and it's so annoying! It is also stupid. Also it is the worst show I ever seen!
1,Zero Stars Doesn't Seem to Be an Option,"As the old adage tells us, ""If you can't say something good, then don't say anything at all.""With that in mind, since a review would be pointless if I said nothing, I must obviously say something positve about ""Skills of the Vagabonds.""Hmmm....let me think a moment. OK, ""Skills of the Vagabonds"" gave me my first opportunity to try out Amazon.com's return policy.Oh my, I'm feeling generous now that I realize I will be able to recoup some of my losses. Here's another positve thing about ""Skills of the Vagabonds"": the cover art is not terrible.That pretty much exhausts the positive aspects of this book, so I shall say nothing more."
1,Cinderella Accessories,"The toy was ok but not durable at all, when my daughter first opened it the articles were not firm enough to be worn by her."
1,I don't get it.,"I've never read any of Pratchett's stuff before. Someone bought this book for me as a gift. I tried reading it. I got to page 120 and just gave up. This book is boring, pedantic, and tedious. Maybe I just don't get the jokes. Maybe I need to be more familiar with ""disc world"" or whatever it's called. But this book sucks. There is no character development. There is virtually no description of what the characters look like. This book is simply a plodding nightmare with a confusing plot and pretentious philosophy. I know, the book is supposed to be tongue-in-cheek; and the philosophy is supposed to be an in-joke, but I don't get the joke, and Pratchett never takes the time to explain it."
1,"A work of fiction better titled ""special farces""!",The author erroneously tries to pass off his somewhat limited special forces knowledge with too much text. Hardly worth use as toilet paper!
1,"Keeps falling off, needs a better magnet!",I like the design of this dishwasher magnet much better than the typical plastic ones. The main drawback is that the magnet will not stay stuck. It has a very cheap magnet attached (think the ones that are attached to the flimsy trinkets you'd find at a gift store).
1,O.K.,This product is just that O.K. It functions. You need two hands though. If you try to open a bottle the top can come off and render it useless. Not what I expected. Don't get this if you like quality.
1,Bad Anime Series!!!,"It has a stupid plot, bad Character Development, and aweful art!! Pokémon is one of the most aweful Anime I have seen."
1,"Go to "" This is Fabian""","I didn't own this cd, but I have UK product ""This is Fabian"" released by ACE. It has 26 tracks. If you want more Fabian songs, go for that one. If you don't have any Fabian cd, go for that one as all the 10 songs here are included there."
1,Horrible,"I bought this becuase I wanted a hard drive where I could access my files via HTTP over the internet. Unfortunately, the HTTP server simply does not work. After waiting a week for a reply to an email sent to LaCie support, I broke down and called them by phone. After waiting on hold for 1/2 hour, the guy basically told me that the HTTP access is not a supported feature and may not work. He suggested that I could try downloading the new updated software, but that it was beta and might not work either. Ahhh!!!"
1,just okay!!,"This mat is good for the occasional exerciser... Not to suitable for yoga although I do put my yoga mat on top if i am ever on a very hard floor. The cover being washable is good but a pain to get back in right as the cover can shrink...yeah... so you have to work it back in and it takes some time to get the shape back. The padding itself being the foam stuff will over time become thinner as you use it and wear it down. It rolls up nice, not too big. Also when or if you sweat a lot it can get slippery, if you use your hands for support. You will need a towel to keep yourself dry and not let the mat absorb too much of your sweat. It would make a nice camping mat or mat for child in daycare, or for sitting in the park, wherever you may sit or lay down and need an extra cushion..."
1,A complete waste of time.,Why spend Your time gazing at the TV screen watching Pokemon videos when you can curl up with a piece good literature? I highly reccomend the book section of this website.Why spend your time and money on a Junky video you will only watch once? Sarah & Magda
1,Canon 104,"The cartridge life is pathetic and a rip off, sorry to say. It doesn't bode well for the company in terms of ethical advertising. i feel like i am replacing one each month with about 500 pages -- very limited use. In a short period of time, i have paid more for the cartridges than i did the darn printer. I am averaging $800 per year for cartridges.You have got to be kidding.The printer itself is ok so far, however.I would suggest if there are ""compatible"" cartridges at significantly less price, they may be worth trying, especially if they advertising the same specs. does anyone have any experience with similar products?Thank you."
1,Lifespan way too short,"I don't know who in the real world averages 5% coverage, which is Canon's spec for getting 2000 prints out of this unit. So you can't believe you'll get anywhere near 2000 prints. I've been averaging about 600. I love my MF4270 printer and get great quality prints, but the toner life is completely unacceptable."
1,Material fit for a different century - or perhaps millenium,"I found this book to be a racist collection of fanatic opinions which, if addressed toward visible minorities, would be cause for outcry. What I had hoped to be an objective, informative text is simply offensive garble about good and evil. References to the devil or that intermarriage marriage is more damaging to Jews than Hitler are seriously disturbing. If two people in love choose to abandon their future together on the basis of such philosophies then I pity the role of religion in their lives.The physical presentation is as poor as the content. Spiral bound books can also mean spiral bound, one sided BW photocopies of computer printed scripts - where some pages are so poorly photocopied that they are crooked, grey and at times hard to read.I'm promtly returning this material because I cannot morally bear to think that someone would receive one cent of royalties for such efforts."
1,Caveat emptor! 1 Cartridge/month,"Buyer beware! The print life of the cartridge is unacceptable. I've been running through 1 cartridge/month in my small business office! In 3 months, the price on the ink will have passed the price of the printer."
1,Defective when received!!!,I recieved the toner in new unopened condition on time. I needed a spare since my original was showing low. I installed the new toner about a week after I received it. It started printing with 2 wide dark lines on the documents within 2 pages of printing. I tried about 10 pages and reinstalled the old toner cartridge. It worked fine but still showed low toner. I do not have any way to get the toner I purchased warrantied. Is there a way??? If I can get a resonable resolution I will change my feedback.
1,Runs out too quickly,"I have had several printers and used many different types of cartridges and this by far has the worst life. I am constantly changing toner cartridges--at least once a month. The machine will not print faxes if it thinks the catridge is low even though hundreds of more pages could still be printed. I spend at least a week to 10 days every month constantly shaking the cartridge, taking it in and out of the machine, trying to get faxes to print. I will make sure not to have to use canon catridges again when i get a new printer."
1,Kinda outdated,Not real user friendly. I would probably not have bought it if I had known. Looks like the pages were done on a cheap copy machine. Not happy with the product really.
1,You must know your instrunment parts,"Not being a music teacher, I don't really know the names of each instrument parts. Reading through this book I noticed that one must know the technical names of all the musical instrument parts.More illustrations would have been very useful, whether they are pictures or drawings.Conclusion: if you can find online instrument part schematics, it would greatly help."
1,Seemed to drag a bit for me,Stopped halfway. Just didn't work for me - seemed a bit shallow / dragging.
1,Not Impress,"I made a mistake of buying this CD without listening to it first.It has also five music in a CD.I Love to listen to Tango Especially La Cumparsita , La Paloma, A Media Luz,and love to dance Tango...Very Sorry that ""Tango: Zero Hour"" is not my type of music and did'nt impress me."
1,Did not Receive,"I bought this DVD and it was paid for, but I still have not received this DVD and it was purchased May 20th. Very Poor service."
1,Thief of MY Time,"This is one of those unfortunate works that start excellently, even audaciously, take risks, but suddenly fall precipitously to an ignominious conclusion. My hat's off to Pratchett for his brave invention, but in this case the results are mixed.The jokes, puns, take-offs, etc., fly about in rapid-fire, but the author's coyness eventually becomes tedious, and his characters cease to convince. In fact, the best ones--Igor, for example--disappear from the real action in the last third or so of the novel. So does the author, actually; toward the end he seems to lose interest and merely outlines a denouement. Quite a letdown. . . ."
1,Generic sounding American musicians,"I am not trying to be mean, but there is just something very homogenized sounding about this CD: yes, it has lively rhythms, but every song sounds the same, it lacks, to me, what jazz musicians call ""swing.""honestly, it sounds a bit like when conservatory trained classical musicians dabble in ethnic music, its got a kind of corny quality to it.it just feels rather soulless to me.and again, i know this is rather harsh, but its just my opinion.and to be clear, this is a recording made in the usa, i think north carolina. as i recall i dont believe any of the musicians are turkish, not that they neccesarily have to be, but...."
1,No documentation just innuendo!,"This was a very entertaining book, but without documentation or footnotes it was hard to tell if it was fact or fiction. Assumptions were made by the authors many times, but there was no way to tell if it was accurate as there was no proof of any kind whatsoever just lots of innuendo . Where is the proof?? And I don't like the use of quotes as if they were right there taking down dialogue word for word when you know that they weren't. It was a really annoying read. Now, I did enjoy seeing all the new Houdini photographs, but then again they were printed on the same cheap pulp paper as the rest of the book!"
1,DISAPPOINTING,"Oh, how I dearly loved ""The Cape Ann."" How excitedly I ordered, ""The Empress of One"" knowing it was to be a sequel of sorts. Oh, how disappointed I am in this book.Lacking is the verve, the connection, the devotion to character believability. This book falls flat on all counts. Sally's mother is handled tritely in her mental illnes. Sally is a characture of a child, adolescent, and young woman. Her dubious responses to surreal experiences are achingly banal.This is heartbreaking. I know Faith Sullivan can do much better; I have rated her a five in previous reads. Perhaps this was an off book; a forced sequel she was coerced into completing. I will not judge her by this disappointing offering. Read ""The Cape Ann"" and visit her strength and her artistic beauty as a writer. Pass on this one."
1,"Poorly researched, racist, and a waste of time. Don't buy it","Mr. Arostegui defames all of America's Special Forces with his racist comments regarding America's premier force and its founder. His cheap attempt at creating controversy by attributing racist comments and attitudes to a dead American warrior who cannot defend himself is protected from libel only because the lawyers at St. Martin's Press know that a deceased person cannot be libled. Mr. Arostegui, a self-proclaimed ""battle-seasoned reporter"" and ""counter-terrorism expert"" should take his racist attitudes and shoddy journalism back from whence he came. No self-respecting book distributor would sell this trash, and no self-respecting American should buy it"
1,This is some of the most racist comments I have seen.,".This is some of the most racist comments I have seen. Having known Col. Beckwith, and been a member of USA Special Forces I don't believe the so-called author interviewed him, or most of the others he claims to have interviewed.I only rated it as a 1 (worst) because I was unable to write in a minus number! If I was in favor of book burning I would nominate this book for the pile.Walt Shumate, as usual, said it much better than I can.Bob Jac"
1,poor excuse for a book,"This book is disappointing to say the least. Beyond the glaring racist comments and slanderous remarks about the deceased it is extremely shallow in ability to relate the true world of special operations. It's very obvious that the author has never experienced the real thing and, while this doesn't necessairly disqualify him to be able to accurately interpret and portray the roles of those who served, he has definetly failed to understand the subtle complexities of the business. Save your money and look for something with more quality. It won't be difficult to find"
1,Diswasher Magnet,"This is a great idea. It was just what I needed considering, I had an argument with my husband about putting dirty dishes in the dishwasher on top of the clean dishes. Unfortunately, the magnet does not stick at all. The weight and look of it is good, it fits the decor of the stainless dishwasher, but if it's supposed to be a magnet then it should stick."
1,Fell apart!,This item is good looking but fell apart after a couple weeks of light use. The problem with the product is that there is only solid wood top and legs but where you screw the legs into is partical board. Thank heavens my husband is a carpenter and was able to fix this my replacing the partical board. I wouldn't recommend this product.
1,This book was a real waste of money.,I don't know what has happened to Danielle Steele's writing. About the first two chapters of this book were good. Then it just got worse. Not very believable and gets pretty stupid. I really think I wasted my money on this one.
1,NEVER AGAIN,"I read this book because I received it from Doubleday bookclub and neglected to return it initially, as I normally would have. It sat in my laundry room for a year, but out of curiosity (and an open mind for supporting writers, whatever the genre), I read it. I will NEVER read another Danielle Steele book. Since reading The Klone and I, I've heard that Ms. Steele employs ghost writers to pen some of her many stories. That might even be more inexcusable than actually writing such slop. ""Writing"" like this is an insult to readers. If you like romance, read Nora Roberts or Barbara Taylor Bradford. Another good author for romance readers is Maeve Blinchy. These writers put real talent and rich story building into their work."
1,The strap does NOT come attached to the lens cap itself!!!,"The strap does NOT come attached to the lens cap itself, as it looks like it does in the photo. It is one of those separate stick-on things that don't work for more than a few days.The cap itself is alright, but they shouldn't show the strap as if it's attached to the lens."
1,Don't waste your money!,"This fits on my lens but the stap is just a string with no elasticity to it so it just hangs on the lens and falls off, it doesn't hold itself on and the string it too short to connect to my camera and fit over my 250 mm lens. I would not suggest this to anyone, spend a couple more dollars and get one with a elastic band on it."
1,cheap quality,I purchased 2 of these and one of them broke. Because they were so inexpensive it wasn't worth returning. Look for a better quality item.
1,Eh..,"Didn't do what I was hoping, but I'm no expert in the A/V game. I would recommend a more basic description for those without the tech vocab"
1,All Time Greatest Hits Mary Wells,"Unable to play disc on all cd players. Will not play on my Auto or portable player, but does play on CD player on my Desk Top.Very disappointing since all of my Amazon items have been 5 stars, until this order.All-Time Greatest Hits"
1,DO NOT BUY IF YOU HAVE A NEWER IPOD!,"I just got an Ipod Touch, and video out DOES NOT work with this dock. I don't understand why it doesn't work but it's a major bummer!"
1,Misleading description,This is NOT compatible with my Ipod Nano 4th Generation because it will NOT charge it and that was one of the main reasons for purchasing the product. It clearly states in the literature contained within the product packaging but you have to open the package in order to read the literature so you can't return the product. The sound quality is very low when compared to just a regular 3.5 mm connection. Buyer beware with this bunch when it comes to their return policy.
1,"Entertainment Dock great, remote control not so great","Physically, the remote control is not of the same quality as the dock. It has three buttons at the top and a simulated iPod selection wheel below them that is actually 5 discreet membrane type buttons under a disc. The range is about 20ft and even close to the dock the buttons ""miss"". I'm not sure if the problems are purely related to the transmitter/receiver pair or poor quality buttons or both. It is unfortunate as the base and cabling that came with it are of the same solid durable feel as an iPod. The remote alone is what dragged my rating down to a 1."
1,"Good Dock, Lousy RF Remote","The dock portion of this works great. The radio frequency remote is only a tad better than an IR remote. I have to be within three feet of a line of site of the dock for the remote to work. Outside of this range, it simply doesn't perform. I could have saved money and purchased a line of sight with IR remote and bought IR repeaters.Amazon shipped this unit late. It took over 12 business days to get the unit from the time I order it. Free shipping is no bargain. I could have recieved the unit from NewEgg in three days for only a $1 more than I paid at Amazon."
1,"A little known fact for the Dock 500, that will ruin your iPod.","This is a fantastic dock in features, but a little known fact about the Kensington Dock 500 is that it continuously charges your iPod whether the battery is full or not. The problem with this is that it will eventually ruin the battery in your iPod, giving you decreased runtime and eventually killing it altogether. This is why high end battery chargers stop charging when batteries are full. Kensington actually admits to the continuous charging on their website in the FAQ section. I found this out from the staff at a Genius Bar in an Apple Store after I purchased the Kensington dock. Luckily I was still able to return mine and get a dock by a different company that stops charging when the battery is full.I would recommend the Belkin TuneCommand or the Keyspan AV dock. Both of these units are basically identical to the Dock 500; except that they both stop charging when the battery is full. Ohh, and they cost less too."
1,No Deal,Very little volume through my home stereo. I couldn't even hear it in the next room. Then the sound became inaudible. I had to return this piece and they made me pay for shipping.
1,Not plaid,"You are showing, at least in a 46 reg., a picture of a plaid coat and the only choices are herring bone. There is a big difference. This is very misleading. Jos. A. Bank Web site is doing the same thing. Needs to be fixed."
1,ADD 4 STARS! NO MORE HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT!,"First I have to say, I have ordered numerous products from Amazon.com and they are fantastic! I always get my items quickly with absolutly no problems. I have always been satisfied with the things I've ordered, but this entertainment dock is a real disappointment. It charged fine, and I didn't even try the remote (I wouldn't care to have another remote to worry about anyway). As far as the sound quality; it was terrible. There's so much static I can't hear the words. Most other reviews say it sounds great though. Could I be doing something wrong? Any ideas would be greatly appreciated. I love to listen to my Ipod but wearing earphones just isn't convienient. I really would like to give this thing a chance as I don't want to give up just yet. Well, I had it plugged in the wrong input. It was in phono and I switched it to the CD input and now it sounds great! :)"
1,Not worth reading the whole thing.,"After about 30 pages I caught on to the fact that there's no need to actually read this book; you can just flip through and read the section headlines. You get the same effect. The info in the book is all well and good, but seriously how many times can you say the same thing in one paragraph? I guess it's supposed to really drive the ideas home, but... just make it a pamphlet already. It's not a book."
1,Not effective to me.,"From my experience, these kind of healing books don't work well to change my feelings and attitudes. They do have temporary effects, but do not last long. This book also was not the execption. There are many ""Things To Do"" which I should do right now to change my life. But I don't and can't. Always when I read such kind of books, I am firm about trying to do these ""Things"". But I don't take a whim for reading these kind of books again and thus I lose an opportunity to do good ""Things"" entirely. I think volunteering for building GESUNDHEIT INSTITUTE in WEST VIRGINIA and meet PATCH ADAMS is much more effective than reading this book."
1,Missing Pages,"While you said this book was in great shape, the entire first five chapters had been torn out.I believe you should credit me or send another one."
1,basic italian lab manual,THIS BOOK HAD WRITINGS ALL IN THE BOOK. HOW CAN THE SELLER SELL SOMEONE A BOOK IN SUCH BAD CONDITIONS. MY FIRST TIME AD IT WAS A HORRIBLE EXPIERENCE! I RETURNED IT AND NOW I HAVE 2 LOOK SOME MORE
1,Skinny Bones,Skinny BonesAlex is not good at Baseball. As a matter of fact he stinks. Everyone calls him SkinnyBones because he is small and skinny. He has played for many of years. Then one day he brags and gets into trouble with T.J. Stoner. They do a pitching contest and loses. He gets made fun of an T.J Stoner is the best Baseball payer in the town.Everything goes wrong until he wins a Kitty Fritters contest. He wins it on the food his cat eats. This helps kids to like him.I think this book is good because it is funny. I think this is a Middle School book. I think people that like Baseball or sports would like this book. This book is funny because when he throws the ball it rolls over the plate.
1,A Meditation for Mastering Menopause (Health Journeys),"I purchased the grieving cd at the same time and it's wonderful, but this really wasn't even relaxing."
1,"Disappointed they use the voices of a 'bratty child' screaming ""NO!""",It's too bad they ruined this dvd by using voice-overs of children that are saying no in the question-answer section. There is no need for this particular version of the word and if the child watching is into mimicking you may find yourself in trouble. I found this at Redbox in case you want to try before you buy.The rest of the DVD is wonderful though and otherwise would have received 5 stars. Very educational and catchy alphabet song too.
1,"Same Product - Multiple Names , different Prices","Atomic Structure & the Periodic Table (2004) = The Periodic Table : PROPERTIES OF COMPOUNDS = Properties of compounds = Properties of Elements (The Periodic Table for Students)---> all are One and the same, but the prices are Different"
1,The motor is slow,"I had an older Atlas 150 and loved it. It's done well for me over the years. I wanted the motor, but I had to get a whole new set because the motor would not fit on the old hand crack one.When I got it, I found the machine minus the motor hadn't changed much over the years. The motor sounds sturdy and the thing went together pretty easily. My grip is the motor is SLOW. It takes forever to roll out a batch made with a half dozen eggs. Using the motor won't speed the job up, it will slow it down. So only two stars, as the product's feature is the motor."
1,It ain't what it used to be,I should have given more credence to the reviewer who commented that the formula for this product seems to have changed along with its name--now KMS California. My hair is fine and thin. The old formula was great. The new stuff is sticky and heavy. I am very disappointed.
1,Plastic motor housing.,"Yeah, for the money, I'm not sure I would have paid for something with a chrome plastic motor housing. Cheap construction quality. I just don't understand why they would cheap out with the motor?... Perhaps another item made in China."
1,No Video Out on New iPods,I had a 5th Gen iPod and everything worked great. Now I have a iPod Classic. Video out no longer works.Careful. This product is obsolete. :(
1,"Instructions were wrong, with disastrous results....","I successful changed the battery in my 2G iPod and so thought I could handle this one, a 60 GB iPod Video. Guess I was wrong. I was actually able to crack the case with the included tools (on the 2G I had to resort to a chisel). The instructions talk about prying up a locking clip with the tool so that you can remove the ribbon cable. I dutifully did that, but as it turns out, there is no locking clip, at least on mine there isn't, and prying with the tool simply breaks off the connector. The ribbon cable was in there with simple friction, so you could easily just pull it out and later push the new one back in. There was also a black sleeve over the end of the ribbon cable that needed to be removed (not mentioned in the instruction video). Knowing these two things, I could now successfully replace my battery, but instead I've got a broken iPod. Caveat Emptor."
1,rough fabric,"fit was fine, but fabric was very rough. It was like wearing a burlap sack, just tougher."
1,The Liberace of Murder Mysteries,"Any guy who describes ordinary, everyday headlights being turned off as ""the extinguishing of two vanilla flames,"" and admires himself for his powers of description, shows very little taste or judgment as a writer. All his books are clotted with these inappropriate flights of fancy-ness (he's the Liberace of murder mysteries), but this one is icky clear through. His characters are real-ish, if tiresomely self absorbed and never quite likeable (his own alter-ego, the doctor, is tediously PC and selfconscious), the plot potentially intriguing enough, when he gets to it, even the dialogue works much of the time, but, as usual, the endless detail of whether you turn right or left to get to his favorite hangouts, the florid descriptions of place and vista which never really come off, those go on for pages and chapters and make you forget whether you ever cared who done it and how come. Bleh."
1,Awful,"I rented this thinking that it was a documentary. Boy, was I wrong. It's edited like a music video. It is shot as if Braddock, his wife and family are all being interviewed during the actual events of Braddock's life. ( Ie. Braddock saying"" I know I ain't gonna get anudda chance like dis"" or a promoter saying ""Dat night he found anudda reason ta fight. Ta save the life of his wife and kids."") Ugh. The film by Ron Howard shows Braddock and his wife to be brave, heroic people. This thing by ESPN makes them out to be self pitying losers. Skip this and rent the Crowe film."
1,disappointed!,The product arrived damaged; I returned it asap! It seems that too many businessmen out there don't appreciate the good business sense of properly packaging and protecting the products that they sell or bother to make sure that they're in perfect shape to begin with!
1,Not what you think,"I received this today and instead of what is pictured I received a green rock and a yellow rock. They were not multi color like the picture and there is only one per order, not 3 like pictured. Also it states on the front of the package that it is ""the rock floats"" yet on the back in small print it reads ""use caution near water--this product sinks like a rock!"" Also it states on amazon for romping and chomping but also in the small print it states "" the Rock is NOT a chew toy. Excessive chewing may damage the product"". So I am confused what is this for? Well we also took them out and played fetch. They each lasted around 3 throws before they decided to bust down one of the seams."
1,Dog chewed right this,"Sorry. We have a Cattle Dog and she destroyed this in record time. If you have a ""El Destructo"" dog, you're better off with Nylabones."
1,Pretty Good,I love New Orleans. This book is pretty good. However. It needs either more recipes and less pictures or vice versa. It's trying to do too much and kind of fails to do either.
1,Meh.,"I've read most of his books, and am a fan, but this one just didn't cut it for me.I guess, like others, my biggest beef was the Emma character. What little character development Mr. White did resulted in little more than a whiny bitch.Also, the high-tech stuff left me thinking that perhaps he is thinking about writing in the Sci-Fi genre. Meh.I understand that Mr. White will be ending this series of books with the next one after ""Line of Fire."" It will be interesting to see what he does next, because I really consider him to be a talented writer."
1,Not much here,"I've listened to about half of the audiobook on CD and it does absolutely nothing for me. Very general information. Too much focus is on the ""what"" to do, but not on ""how"" to do it. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone - male / female, young / old, etc. There are much better books and audiobooks out there."
1,Disappointed,"I have read all of Stephen White's books. This was the only one that I really didn't like and struggled to get through. Lauren was just too pathetic, the plot twists were absurd and even Alan (my favorite character) was a bit hard to take. If you're a Stephen White fan you have to read it just to do so, but definitely check this one out of the local library rather than purchasing it. If you're not a White fan, don't bother with it."
1,spurious logic,"This is a book rich in logical flaws, wrongheaded conclusions, and outright mistakes. ..."
1,Fame Over Acting.... Again,"I'm not going to lie, I only rented this movie because I was curious about Batista's acting skills. And this is the reason it's getting 2/5 stars.As far as the storyline goes, it's a pretty typical 'seek and revenge' setting. Movies like this seem to never get old to me though so that was fine. The only thing that completely killed it for me was Batista's acting, he could not get away from his bad-boy wrestling act the ENTIRE movie which is fine for 5 minutes in the ring but dragging it out for an hour and a half was dreadful. He was dull, emotionless, ""too cool for school"", and looked like he was staring at a wall in his dialogue - it never changed not once and it got old.If they would've gone with a different actor for the main character this movie would've had great potential, but they didn't so *insert fart noise here*."
1,AWFUL,ONE OF THE WORST MOVIES I EVER VIEWED. FROM THE CASTING TO THE DIALOGUE TO THE ACTING TO THE PLOT TO THE ENDING. THERE IS NO CHEMISTRY BETWEEN THE TATTOOED HULK AND THE PETITE BLOND. THE HULK CANT ACT. HIS LINES AND PHYSICAL MOVES REMINDED ME OF A HIGH-SCHOOL PLAY. THERE WERE TOO MANY BAD CHARACTERS MAKING IT DIFFICULT TO KEEP THEM SEPERATED AND MOST OF THEM WERE ELEMINATED BEFORE THEY HAD AN OPPOTUNITY TO DEVELOP THEIR ROLE.
1,This was boring.,"It did have a bit of skill, but honestly I could have slept while reading it if that was possible."
1,LET'S HOPE HE'S GOTTEN IT OUT OF HIS SYSTEM,"I suppose every author writes a clinker now and then. After reading and loving the previous four books, I was stunned at the outright dullness of this ""effort."" I never felt any real suspense, nor did I find myself wanting to find out who the ""bad guy"" was. I didn't even care when his identity was revealed. At no time did I feel that Lauren was in any real trouble or that Emma might actually come to harm. I am confident that this book was a glitch, and that future White volumes will return to his normal high standards. I bought this one, after having checked out his previous four. A waste of money, to say the least."
1,Horrid,"The acting is so completely bad, it's actually a tone for the whole movie.New York accents all done by non New Yorkers and done in the worst way, all in uniform.Awful. NO STARS"
1,so so,"I won't go into detail because others have, but although this book was well-researched and had many plot twists and turns, it was still incredibly boring. It was my first Stephen White book and I am not sure if I will read more.My other issue was with Emma Spire - her character was not developed enough. It was not clear why the media would be so obsessed with her other than the murder of her father."
1,Food review,It is very mild and a bit disappointing from the sorghums that I remember from years past. I will not purchase this brand again.
1,"Weak story, weak characters, weak book","This was my first SW book and probably my last. The plot was interesting for about 30 pages and then simply stopped being interesting. Unbelievable characters - I hate it when the protagonists in a series have earth shattering, life threatening experiences in every book - and the McGuffin held my interest for about 0 seconds. Too much put into too many pages. Additionally, what drove me crazy were all these similar sounding names of the main characters (Casy - Cozy, Sam - Scott). And there were too many characters, 2 policemen, 2 lawyers, very confusing. The only reason I gave it 2 stars is the fact that I read it completely and didn't throw it out after 50 pages as I usually do with duds."
1,Poor taste,"I was really disappointed with the Sorghum we purchased. We have been users of it for over 50 years, and have previously had bought it from other vendors, usually from Indiana. This product, though sweet, did not have the expected molasses taste. It was just too bland.Walter C. Daniels"
1,Not your grandmother's sorghum,"I ordered a quart of ""pure sorghum syrup"" and it was delivered in good condition, packaged well, and arrived quickly to my doorstep. That is where the compliments end. This was not sorghum. It was pale and sweet with a weird aftertaste, and had a taste more like karo corn syrup than anything that is like sorghum molasses. I was very disappointed and had to throw it out since no one would eat it. If you like karo corn syrup on your pancakes this is for you. Sadly not for me."
1,Not what was expected!!,"I searched for a long time yo find sorghum syrup. After receiving my JUG of Barry Farm sorghum syrup, I still have not found it!! It was totally tasteless and goopy. I spent nearly fifty plus years in the food and food relatedindustry, I've experienced the very best and a good deal of the worst, this product belongs to the latter...enough said!"
1,Sorghun not sorghum?,"The product was cloudy and pale, not dark and clear like true sorghum syrup. The taste and mouthfeel was more reminiscent of gum acacia or gelatin. I was very dissapointed and discarded the material as unappetizing at best. I found another supplier who is a member of the sorghum syrup producers association and displays their logo."
1,late and short,I found Barry farms through amazon and ordered 46 oz of sorghum from their website on 6/25. After my third email requesting a tracking no. I received an email from postal service stating that the product was being mailed on 7/2. No responses directly from Barry farms. I received my order and it was 32 oz quart jar and my invoice states 46 oz. I emailed them again.
1,Stick with MKSAP,"The answers to the questions are the strength of this book. The questions themselves are much less clinical than the scenarios seen in MKSAP or Case Files. Overall, the book is closer to Step 1 prep than Shelf or Step 2. With the IM Shelf being one of the most difficult to finish in the alloted time, practice with clinical vignettes--as opposed to matching and 2 line scenarios--is more realistic and high yield. Buy MKSAP and Case Files instead."
1,A Genuine Flop!,"The author himself must have been on ""remote control."" The book was simply dull and boring from start to finish. There was so little in it to keep you interested that by the time you reached the end, you forgot what happened at the first - nor did you care! I waited anxiously to buy it, then wished I could have taken in back for a refund."
1,House of the rising sun,"It was an ok movie but I'm not use to seeing Bautista get his but kicked like he is nothing. I expected more of an action role, and this was more like a drama suspense type movie"
1,broken battery connector,"I had the same experience as two other reviewers. Directions for removing and reinserting battery ribbon cable are very unclear, especially the part about rotating the tool. I rotated the battery connector right off, and I am usually pretty handy. Useless Ipod now."
1,Disappointed,"I am using this on my iMac and it works... sometimes. I bought it to charge/sync my iphones with the idea of charging them when the computer was logged off. Not only doesn't it work that way but sometimes it has to be reset to even ""see"" what is plugged into it. Sometimes during a sync it will disconnect or sync very slowly. If you are going to use this hub like I am, move on to something else."
1,Ugh.,"The problem with this hub is that it has horrible latency. If you're planning on plugging a thumb drive or external hard drive into this, forget it. If you're trying to run a keyboard & mouse, it'll probably work fine. Go from the point of view that anything with an extremely low data rate will work just fine, but anything else is going to have major issues."
1,Mold,"I received the Royal King Brand Ginseng Royal Jelly 30x10ml that I purchased in the mail today. One bottle was cracked and others were empty. There was no fresh liquid leaking in the package just the old dried stains so it must have leaked a long time ago, not while in transit. There was also dirt, filth, mold and cobwebs growing on the bottles inside the package."
1,not pleased,bought this for a cross draw. holster is a little bulky. the draw is stiff and catchy with no tension adjustment. going back the shoulder setup. would not recommend.
1,Battery-Eater,Bet the designed circuit or the one that I bought has problem. It is a battery eater even it is off. Every few days batteries have to be replaced even it hasn't been used if I don't take the batteries outta it. So far my battery cost more than this camera.
1,POS,This system is a complete POS! I have had less than a year and have had nothing but problems...and HP customer service..the worst. If you have a couple of spare hours to take care of problem and dont mind being transfered from India to Houston to Costa Rica to PaloAlto all on the same call and still got nothing accomplished. Customer Service fails to listen to their customers and forget about anyone returning your call. There are some serious hardware design problems with this unit or they got [...] parts from their suppliers.
1,Camera does not power on,"When I opened the camera and took it out of the box, I inserted the batteries and the camera is not powering on, it does nothing at all. What do I need to do?Best regards,"
1,blurry pics in macro,"i received this camera as a gift from another amazon customer and although i found it easy to figure out, it came with NO USB cord so i had to purchase one to go with it. i also take alot of pictures of rescued animals and found that every picture i took in macro of newborn pups, they were all blurry. the only pictures that came out clear were the ones i took at a distance. i even went as far as downloading the manual to see if there was something i may have been doing wrong, but i had all the settings as instructed and it STILL took blurry pics up close. returned this camera and got a better one. i do not recommend this camera if you are looking for pics with detail and clarity"
1,Anyone can find a group of opposing views,"Specifically as a movie, it was OK at best. My problem with any movie as this, it's easy to be the Monday morning quarter back and state what could've, should've and would've. If I had the time and money I bet I could find the same amount of people with a 100% opposing view to this movie. No doubt, war is ugly. It appeared way too biased for me. The agenda appeared to be more of a smear campaign."
1,Extremely short lifespan: 2 died on me,"These were good monitors for my video editing for about a year until one of them developed a hum/buzz. I researched and found out that apparently this model has some kind of power/capacitor issue and dies quickly. I bought a replacement and 6 months later another speaker started buzzing! Moreover, M-Audio/Avid has terrible customer service, I do not recommend these at all."
1,Not impressive,"I'm an M-Audio fan, I love their pre-amps, but these really miss the mark. There is a huge lack of bass which has lead to many problems with mixing my music. When I showed the re-engineered sound to my director, the results weren't good. I mixed the audio flat but it played with more bass than hip-hop music. These were a big disappointment. Save for awhile more and treat yourself to a good pair of monitors."
1,Buyer Beware,"I purchased these monitors through Amazon.com in November of 2009 and was impressed with the value and the sound quality, until the right monitor crapped out two months later (January 2010). Seems to be the on/off switch. M-Audio assesses a support/tech fee after 30 days of ownership and are not at all supportive. The seller has yet to contact me about repair, or replacement. I have now read (wish I had before my purchase) about identical problems with these monitors. I would obviously not recommend these, or any M-Audio products to anyone."
1,Cheaply built... Just google them,"Im not using these in my studio... Rather, for my TV sound system. These actually sound surprisingly good... They'd be great if MAudio didnt cheap out on components. Just Google the capacitor issues these things have. Its a well known issue that causes one or both of them to go dead suddenly and the company is no help with helping fix the issue. I've bought 3 single ones to complete my pairs (and conveniently the company doesn't sell them single) I'm about to just throw them in my junk room and buy something else"
1,Good for Light Use,"I am a heavy duty mechanic by trade and I bought this for use in some of the smaller jobs at work. Well, it broke in less than a month. The drive tip snaped off while I was tightening down some fuel pump bolts. I really do like the design and it is easy to change from forward to reverse with one hand, but I thought the quality would have been better. I think the wobble head design seriously weakens the drive tip. I guess I should have bought the standard tip model but who knows. It would be great around the garage at home but I wouldn't call it a professional grade tool."
1,"Vague, Verbose, Quasi-scientific","The explanations in this text are not carefully worded. If you're actually trying to learn concepts and understand the material in any deep fashion this text will confound you and leave you with a shallow overview with some ""tools"". They throw up some formulas and wave their hands around a lot. When it comes to precise explanations and scientific concepts, this book is lacking. It gives you the vocabulary necessary to recognize the topics and ideas, but not the depth of knowledge necessary to actually UNDERSTAND and assimilate the science on any deep level.Overall, it's a sloppy text that does a sloppy job of introducing this topic."
1,With pleasure.,It is always amusing to come across a work that favors form over content. But perhaps scholarly books are not really designed to be read for this kind of entertainment - I have the feeling that someone is missing the point here.
1,Do not recommend this product - too small and leaky,"I was expecting this ball to be fairly large since it was stated to be 65 cm. However, I found this ball to be the smallest exercise ball I've ever seen once fully inflated. All the different brands of 65 cm balls at my gym are fairly large, so I expected this one to be similar in size. It turns out this ball is smaller than any 65, or even 55 cm ball for that matter, that I've ever seen (it looks like it could be rated at 45 cm). I'm relatively short at 5'5"" but this ball was far too small for me. Although the ball is made up of what feels like higher quality material, it does not hold air in very well. Without any use of the ball, it is able to remain firm for about 1 week. I was fairly disappointed with this ball since it looks and feels nice, but is way too small and leaky."
1,WORST Peanut Sauce EVER,This doesn't even taste like peanuts! It's just vinegar. The people who made this crud have never tasted real THAI peanut sauce. DO NOT EVER BUY THIS!
1,This is almost laughable... Now I've seen it all.,"The christian agenda has as its primary aim to ""trump"" the rights of all other groups, especially those of people who aren't exactly the same as them.No gay person I have met has ever said christians shouldn't be allowed to get married, or that it would be okay for a christian to be bashed in the street, or made unemployed because of their faith. However, christians never miss an opportunity to express the opinion that it's okay for gay people to be treated this way. You get on with your faith, and leave us alone, and we will be happy to do the same.What a pile of ridiculous, paranoid, rubbish. Open your eyes!"
1,"Silly, Shrill, and a little bit Funny","If I didn't know that some folks would actually believe this silliness, I could laugh more at this book. How sad that serious, REAL Christianity is continually given a black eye by people like this. There is virtually nothing here based on fact, and virtually nothing based on the Bible. This book represents the worst kind of misreading of Scripture and current events. Only a moron would take this stuff seriously. The only positive thing that can be said for it is that I did laugh out loud a few times."
1,It should be called,The Christian Agenda: We must brainwash more people. This book is full of propaganda and lies. The authors should be ashamed.
1,Not my type of man,"The book wasn't badly written but I just couldn't get into it. Other reviewers have covered the plot so I won't.My problem was the hero. I'm sorry but I want to WANT the hero and I didn't in this book. The first time we meet him the heroine herself says he is ""not handsome or agreeable in anyway"". When the author is describing what he looks like I thought she was describing some villian we would come to know, not the man the heroine (and myself) are supposed to fall in love with. He is described as old with graying hair, a huge scar on his face and a limp. This doesn't make for a very sexy man. I'm sorry but my husband has his own flaws, I don't need to read about somebody else's husband's flaws too!!"
1,Major Disappointment! =(,"- I stopped at page 100. And ""ditto"" on Greer's attributes already mentioned here.- I've really enjoyed Julia London in the past, (""The Hazards of Hunting a Duke"" was wonderful!) but ""Greer"" was *so* ridiculous: winey, prejudiced, hypocritical, and downright stupid! Her actions, her attitude, even her dialogue! I honestly couldn't find one thing I liked about her.Greer takes Percy, a complete stranger she has met on a public coach, at his every word, for absolutely everything he says, simply because he is smooth and polite and knows how to lay on the charm; where Rhoderick is quiet, honest, albeit, somewhat suspicious and brusque. (And who wouldn't be if some stranger showed up on your doorstep and demanded money? )- I thought perhaps it was just a mood so I put the book down and tried again a couple other times to read it. Nope! No better! I can only recall one other time I have ever put a book down and not completed reading it. This was very disappointing for me! =("
1,This Book Stinks,"Read pages 114 through 116 of this book and double over in laughter at the stupidity of ""historians."" Savor the scorn the author heaps on Fawn Brodie for daring to call out the obvious truth that Jefferson had a LOT of SEX with his slaves. Oh, the high brow elegance of Cunningham's attack! Oh, the elegance of his reductio ad absurdum! Weep at Cunningham's ridiculing conclusion ""The evidence indicates that any Paris romance between Jefferson and Hemmings belongs in a work of fiction, not of history.""This is enough to give you hemmeroids from laughter! But contemplate the shame of wasting your entire career on painting a picture of the ""PURSUIT OF REASON"" by the demi-god Jefferson only to have DNA prove that YOU were the one guilty of POMPOUS NEAR-RELIGIOUS FICTIONAL SELF DELUSION. Imagine being the historians who missed the CENTRAL FACT OF JEFFERSON'S WHOLE SEXUAL PERSONA.This is sweet irony that is too delicous to pass up. This book smells. Buy Fawn Brodie."
1,toxic ingredients- VERY unhealthy...get another brand,"This product contains sodium benzoate aka ""benzene"" ... it's been proven that benzene destroys the immune system. In fact without benzene in a patient AIDS can not thrive. If you have taken this toxin you MUST detox it out of your body by taking vitamin b-2 (www.lef.org is a nonprofit organization that sells the purest vitamins and publishes the absolute LATEST scientific research) For more information on benzene please read The Cure For All Diseases by Dr. Hulda R.

1,False Representation,"This book was advertised as ""Like New."" When we received it, the book was full of underlined text (in pen!) and check marks."
1,"Hate to burst your bubble, but.. . .","I was using this as a seat at my computer desk, and unfortunately, it got a slow leak within a week.Pumping it up again did not help, though it is possible I simply received a defective item, or my [persnickety] cat took out its aggression on this ball while I was away.That being said, I CAN tell you that using it as a seat will offer you a good core and stability exercise. I was enjoying the subtle, but constant workout of my abs and lower back, which is why I was so disappointed when it deflated."
1,"I liked the color very much, but not much else.",I think if they didn't have a sandal foot the hose would be a lot better. Perhaps my feet are too small to fill the sandal foot part though it didn't appear that way but once i put my pumps on the sandal foot started to bulk up and it looked like sagging skin. The hose also sagged at the legs just didn't look flattering at all.
1,Amateurish editing,"I bought this CD because I couldn't find a release of Alpert's album 'Rise' on CD. Well, the songs from the original Rise album are not the original versions. The song 'Rise' is cut down with about a minute, and the bad thing is you can hear where the cut was made, it's not done very well. Then for no seemingly logic reason at all the song 'Rotation' is faded in the end. I don't know why on earth they did that, only to save about 30 seconds from the original running time??? I was very irritated from this. Then the three last songs are really just crap. 'This guy's in love with you' is a very nice tune though. But I'd rather buy a dedicated Herb Alpert and the Tijuana Brass best-of-CD instead of this, and then I WANT A RE-RELEASE OF THE ORIGINAL RISE ALBUM ON CD...PLEASE! It seems to have gone out of print, which is understandable but no excuse for not printing up more copies. Also the price of this cd is ridiculously high and not justified. Sorry but I simply cannot recommend it."
1,The worst stockings I've ever owned,"- Incredibly tight, including the legs and feet- Got multiple runs within the first few hours- Control top was merciless, rolled uncontrollablyI took these off when I got home from work and threw them in the trash. And no, they weren't too small. I ordered up. From now on will be investing in quality hosiery like Spanx."
1,Poor purchase,"I would highly recommend avoiding this item. I read these reviews, and I considered myself technically savvy enough to figure out any problems I encountered with this product. Right out of the box, half of the ports consistently didn't work. I tried using the ones that did, and every few minutes the hub would disconnect and reconnect, causing my two external drives to reconnect as well- if I had been writing data to them, it could have been very bad... So I played around with safe devices for a while and didn't have any successful attempts to get the hub working.Long story short: don't be dumb like me and ignore the bad reviews- if you get stuck with a lemon, it's essentially worthless. Unless you like returning things.(Two stars because if it had worked, the small size and amount of ports is a big plus.)"
1,Wrong AC Adapter shipped!,"Included in the package is the wrong AC adapter that can't even plugin. It puzzled me how this can happen. The only explaining maybe they sent me a customer returned product and the previous owner packed the wrong AC adapter with it. Very disappointing. While it works well without AC adapter on some device, any USB device that draws more power (like portable HD) will require it to be plugged in to power."
1,Wrong cable supplied,"I purchased two of these Startech ST7200USB USB hubs in the past (from another online retailer). They worked great! Almost all of my USB devices connected via the hub worked as if they were directly connected to the computer - this includes some pretty heavy duty devices. So when I bought a laptop and decided I need two more, of course, I thought, I must buy the same hubs again. Well, Both of the hubs purchased through Amazon.com came with a wrong cable included. The cables for powering the device are fine; but the cables supplied for connecting the hub to the computer are A/Male to micro male USB connectors, not the USB A/Male to B/Male obviously required (as seen in the photo). I've used the Startech support website to see if they'll correct the problem. No fix yet. As is, these are useless - can't even connect to the computer!"
1,worthless piece of trash,"This hub appeared to work fine at first, but then I discovered that it works only intermittently, and I wasted lots of time trying to find a workaround, and figure out just where the problem was. My trackball was repeatedly failing, and needed to be unplugged and plugged back in again. My external HD was losing its connection, and had to be yanked out, and the same with my flash drive. This is risky as it can cause data loss and (I'm led to believe) possibly damage the hard drive. DO NOT BUY THIS HUB. You will regret it if you do."
1,Didn't work,"The product doesn't work. I plugged it in and after a couple of hours, my devices stopped working. I thought it was a problem with the peripherals, but alas, it was not, as I plugged them back directly into my computer and they worked fine. Disappointing..."
1,Piece of Junk,The hub only works intermittently. I have to disconnect and reconnect it regularly to in order to make it work. Totally useless.
1,"Worked for a few month, then stopped working","Loved it, then it broke, now I wish I'd not purchased it. There's not much to love/hate about a USB router other than its reliability, which puts this into the ""avoid"" category as far as I'm concerned. Go elsewhere for your hub needs, like the d-link 7-port hub or the Cyberpower one."
1,Dropped Connections,First experience with more than a 4-port hub. This one kept dropping my connection. Had to return it.
1,Broke within the Week,"The hub worked fine for a few days, I was very happy with it. BUt one day when I turned on my computer windows kept telling me that I had an unrecognized USB device, and that none of my items plugged in through the USB hub were being recognized. I reached down and noticed the unit was very hot, too hot to touch, and was a fire hazard. I'm returning it and buying a name-brand hub, costs a little more but obviously worth it. Avoid this product."
1,OK Tiil It Burns Up,"Bought this from Amazon on September 1, 2007. Worked great for about 3-1/2 months. It burned up (well,not quite, just got extremely hot) and quit working on 12/14/2007."
1,KMS HAIR MOLDING PASTE,This paste was kind of thick even though you rub it in your fingers to make it smooth before you put it in your hair. It pieces and separates your hair but only use a little bit.
1,None,"Admittedly, I did not purchase this whole book, but when I downloaded the sample, all I got was the cover picture, the publishing info, etc. Not a word from the book itself. As a customer (and they do say ""the customer is always right"") I hereby command Amazon to feel bad about this."
1,A minus one star product,"Product limits you to 25 attempts, then register, or register at the first attempt. Attempting to register this product is frustrating, the product insists on a pre-determined country, if it is UK, then it searches for the UK internet output/modem, for USA it declines all attemtpts to register, giving an error ""no internet connection"". After various attempts to register it insists on a phone number. Finally I abondoned my quest, and put the disk to rest...................."
1,How can I possibly give this cd such a bad review?,"I purchased this cd after only hearing the brilliantly arranged/performed ""Katie Cruel"" on Pandora.com. Absolutely fascinating! The reviews of this cd here on Amazon were so positive. And from what I understand, Bert Jansch is very influential in the folk scene. The cd art work is very nice, the guitar playing here is drop-dead beautiful, the tunes are all good, but why does he have to sing lead on most of his songs??? One kinder reviewer here related Bert's voice to a sinus infection. I believe it is worse. He regularly drifts into degrees of flatness, has awful phrasing, and frequent unintelligible mumblings that are simply not musical. Sort of reminds me of another great, John Renbourn, only not even that good.I will not continue to listen to this cd, despite the great guitar. too bad for me. I truly hope I can find some of Bert's music that is performed without his singing. If I do I will probably purchase it."
1,Worst thing I ever put in my hair!!,This KMS molding paste is just what it says (Paste or even Glue or Cement.) It is horrible. I couldn't go to bed without washing it out of my hair. I was intending to send it back but decided it wasn't worth spending the return postage so I recently threw it away.
1,"Snappy Dresser, Horrible DJ !!","Those quirky slave trenders known as ""THEY"" have termed Mr. Sanchez the ""Fashionable DJ"". Based on the cover of this cd, one has to give Sanchez points for his fashion sense....however, after several plays of this cd, I still don't get it! For starters, the tune selection here is very obtuse and only suitable for background music at an artshow for stuff nobody hangs on their walls !! Sanchez has all the mixing skills of a kindergarten teacher playing musical chairs with her class....the abrupt stops and starts don't add to this cd! Hey Frederic....its called ""CONTINUOUS MIX""...try it !! This cd goes in 20 different directions and never develops into anything but a headache !! I tried to find one saving grace on this album but alas, I'm at a loss. I loved ""Human Fly"" when the Cramps did it back in the 80's but the new version doesn't add anything !! This cd is one expensive frisbee.....avoid it unless you are close personal friend of Mr. Sanchez !!"
1,WARNING!!!!!!!!!,"I bought this Mannequin Head, and when I opened the box it wasn't the Mannequin head that's in the picture. The hair ISN'T Human Hair, it's an synthetic hair. When I tried to style the hair using a Curling Iron the hair melted like plastic. Human Hair does not melt. So this is FALSE ADVERTISEMENT. BEWARE!!!!!!!"
1,Price Gouging!!!!!!!!!!!,THIS IS A RIDICULOUS PRICE!!! HERE IN OHIO THIS PRODUCT RETAILS AT $18.99 FOR A BOTTLE OF 50 TABLETS! THIS IS A RIP OFF AND I WILL NEVER PAY THIS MUCH FOR A BUNCH OF THIEVES!
1,"Same Product - Multiple Names , different Prices","The History of the Periodic Table ==Atomic Structure & the Periodic Table (2004) ==The Periodic Table : PROPERTIES OF COMPOUNDS ==Properties of compounds ==Properties of Elements (The Periodic Table for Students) == ---> all are One and the same, but the prices are Different"
1,I don't agree,"I can't believe the other reviewers liked this book. I thought it was drivel. Ok, it was mildly entertaining if you could overlook the inconsistancies in time, geography, and stupid stereotypes about the people in the book. (not to mention the glaring lack of depth of characters and plot) But my main complaint about the book is, (I live in Oklahoma) that at the very least, the author could have picked up an Oklahoma map to make sure the characters were on the right highway to their destinations. If this is a ""true story"" use real towns and highways, if it is fiction, don't try to pass it off as true.It is very unbelievable."
1,"Not the best on Optimization, but good on security","The Security section is in depth and gives good detail. Personally, I bought this book for the Performance Tuning chapter of the Optimization section and was very disappointed. It's very short and was written in bullet points. Try this, try that, etc. Few explanations of why. Seems to me like the authors really don't know the subject.I'd recommend the book Performance Tuning Microsoft Networks by Eric Wise instead, which I bought more recently if you are just looking for NT optimization info like I was. It gives more detailed explanations, is more up to date, and covers TCP/IP."
1,Didn't work,I bought this hair product and the product didn't work. It wouldn't dispense any of the product. I returned the product for a full refund and did not buy a new one. I do not know how the product works. I am giving 1 star due to the bottle not even working.
1,Savage from garbage ???,"We ordered this from Nature and Herbs fulfilled by Amazon, so we thought we will get a good product. When we opened the package, it was a horrid sight. Some bottles were crack and dried fluid everywhere. It must have cracked long time ago. Some labels were torn and missing, so it must be like that when it was packaged. It sure like someone pick it out of the reject piles and repackage it. The expiry date is a laughable small piece of paper seems like produced by a typewritter or printer. I honestly cannot see how anyone can ship this kind of garbage to a customer. If I could give this review a zero star, I would !!!!"
1,Seller was a disappointmet,I will not purchase from this seller again. I did not receive what I ordered and it look over two weeks to receive the order.
1,Pinch skin,"These hose looked nice on, but they pinched the skin on my thighs like a thousand tiny fingernails whenever I bent over and then stood back up."
1,Not for me.,Ordered this to get free shipping. I should have paid for the shipping. But I didn't know what Miso was and wanted to try it. If you are not a true fish lover I don't recommend it.
1,An average biography (Two and half stars),"This book is a fairly good introduction to Jefferson, although it is rather short for a biography of one of our most intelligent presidents. The book seemed to quickly skim over his life, for example giving only one chapter to each of his presidential terms. The Lewis and Clark expedition is barely mentioned and I would have liked to know everything that led up to that famous journey. His scientific achievements are also only alluded to during the course of the book. Although it is an easily readable book, I came away wanting to know much more and feeling I did not know the man. Compare this to the excellent John Adams: A Life, and this biography falls well short. If you want a short summation of Jefferson, then this book will suffice."
1,Shipping twice the cost of the item,"Shipping is over twice the cost of the item. Hmmmmm, wonder if they're selling any?"
1,Not for everybody,"This book isn't for everybody; it certainly wasn't for me. Granted, I was so unimpressed that I didn't finish it, so take that as you see fit. This book reads like a college essay, covering the same points over and over and over and using exaggerated and sometimes unrealistic examples. The book talks about how thoughts aren't reality and how everyone's perspectives are different - common sense things like that.This book mainly brings people back from the edge to an equilibrium state by pounding some basic principles into their minds. I feel I'm already at the state he tries to bring you to, and his suggestions won't make a person like me happier.If you're looking for common sense and equilibrium, I recommend this book, but if you're looking for something more, I'd say to move along."
1,Terrible improvement...,"I was a big fan of these when last I bought them...The new and improved flavor is no improvement at all.It starts off ok, but you soon realize that any sweetness that the mints had is gone.Very disappointing. They're not the same at all. :("
1,Not happy with this,"I was not happy with this at all. It would not fit my shower. I moved to a new home and it would not work there either. It was a total waste of money, but by the time I figured this out, it was too late to return."
1,It might be drenching if you were a leprechaun,"But if you're a normal-sized person, this is nothing like the ""Sunflower"" (can-type) drenching spa showers. My home has great water pressure and terrific water flow, and using this showerhead is like standing under a VERY gentle summer rain (definitely non-drenching)---it doesn't even deliver the same water flow as my normal showerhead. Go for a slightly more expensive option, like the Pegasus 8"" sunflower. I gave it a fair try (it's been in for months now), but this showerhead is not worth even its modest price; although my husband is kicking up a fuss about his installation labor, I am taking mine out and installing a different showerhead."
1,Spend the money toward a better one,I bought this for my nephew. He loved it functionally. On a visit just 9 months later I was visiting and had a chance to use it. He had to rig a support for the gooseneck to keep it focused on him. This had broken just a few months into his ownership. I bought him the S-style from Amazon.com at a greater price and it's worth every penny. He loves it and it has a much greater span of spray plus range of motion on the head movement.
1,WaterPik Cascadia,"Very disappointing. The shower head itself is massive - the size of a small dinner plate. It is attached to a long hose which is so flexible it can't support the weight of the head when the shower is in use. Predictably, when you turn on the shower, the head drops groundward, spewing water in a horizontal spray. Installs easily, but save your money."
1,Breaks easily,"I have purchased three of these and all three failed about the same time. It works great at first, and the toggle switch is easy to use. I really enjoyed the experience of having the water fall down on me like rain, and the adjustable arm is maneuverable enough to raise the shower head fairly high. Unfortunately the housing is cheap plastic and breaks easily. I didn't even move the showerhead after the first couple weeks and left it in the same position all the time, but on all three showerheads, the plastic housing broke at the point where the white meets the adjustable arm, and leaked. On two of the models, the adjustable arm failed and would fall down and no longer hold up. There are better and stronger showerheads out there."
1,Agree with the others -- New is NOT improved,"Loved the original. When Walgreens stopped carrying it, ordered from Amazon. Not their fault that flavor has been changed. I assume it was a marketing decision -- not enough volume to continue the formula. But what they decided to use instead is just a weird version of Wintergreen. Not quite as bad (i.e. Pepto-Bismol), but nothing like the addictive Spearmint it replaced. I could chew the old flavor like chewing jelly beans. Now, it's just a strong breath mint like the other Altoids. What a shame."
1,WaterPik Cascadia Showerhead,"WaterPik Cascadia Showerhead is not worth the price. Asother users have stated it will start to sag. It also does not deliver the water pressure one wants from a routine shower. I also found the head clogged easily. Not even going to mess with the warranty, but it was replaced as of tonight."
1,Shower Head Flop,This item is so heavy that the flexible arm will not keep head in position to spray anywhere but wall of shower. I returned item for credit.
1,So sad.,"Mr. Altoids, please let me send you some spearmint. I've got tons of the stuff in my garden and you are clearly running low. Whatever it is you have decided to put in the new spearmint Altoids, it's certainly not much good for eating."
1,I do not recommend.,"I wanted a large diameter showerhead with some power option and purchased this. This shower head is supposed to have a power shower option but I found out that it just narrows the range of shower to the smaller circle (doe snot come out from the full range) and stil weak. You'll just never get warm or soap off yourself by using this shower head. If you are looking for a soft pour, you might like this."
1,a ruined product,"Well, what do you expect. A once great British product, now manufactured in Chattaooga Tennessee--Chatanooga? Now in the hands of an American corporation, the Spermint mint has been untterly ruined--an absolute flop! Undoubtedly the Americans though they could save a little money with the crummy new ingrediants found in their""new phony Spearmint mints."
1,Disappointing,"For a company with a good reputation, I'm very disappointed in Waterpik. The large showerhead is quite heavy and the gooseneck can barely support its weight, so unless you can mount it fairly high up on the wall, the showerhead won't stay at a proper horizontal angle. Or it will stay up for a while, then slowly sag. It has recently developed an annoying whistle; those holes are tiny, so they are probably clogged, but how does one clean this unit since it doesn't come apart? Stay away from this one, and buy something else."
1,Awful new taste for Altoids Spearmint,"Why oh why did Altoids mess with something that has been enjoyed for years? The new flavor for Altoids Spearmint is just plain nasty. My husband and I cannot stand the new flavor. Please please bring back the ""old"" recipe!"
1,This was a letdown.,"I received this as a gift for Christmas and was very anxious to install it and try it out. While the spray itself felt great and I liked that fact that it can be switched from a wide, gentle spray to a concentrated spray, it was overall very disappointing. The arm is not strong enough to hold the head up well - even without the water running. Water also leaks out of the switch that is used to change the spray. We plan on returning this one and purchasing something else."
1,Breaks easily,The flow of water is good. But the &quot;handle&quot; cannot be pulled with even a mild force. We've broken 2 of these and won't buy a 3rd.
1,cascadia showerhead,"This product was a HUGE disappointment. If you have water pressure limitations, DON'T buy this showerhead. I'm replacing mine now."
1,Terrible,"I returned this showerhead the day after I purchased it. The flexible arm is pathetic. I had to fiddle with the thing for 10 minutes just to get it to hold the showerhead up. Then as soon as you tap the showerhead, it falls back down. Ridiculous. Water-Pik should be ashamed of themselves."
1,Nice product but flawed,"We are now on our third showerhead in the past 6 months. Waterpik has been great about replacing the units, but, finally, enough is enough. We did not have a problem with sagging, but did have issues with the switch for spray/shower breaking (all three did), which then created a leaking problem. As we speak, only the center spray position works. The breakage occurs after about 4-6 weeks of use. We have 5 people taking showers every day, which may be the problem with the showerhead.Overall, an under-engineered product for moderate to heavy residential use."
1,Short Life-span.,The Cascadia is hard to get it to stay where you want it. The button that changes the spray pattern broke after about 3 months and is not repairable. Poor plastic construction. I won't buy another one.
1,Curiously BAD .. new great taste!,"Is it possible to obtain the ""Spearmint Naturally Flavored"" my favorite for a long time. I just bought a dozen pack to stock up and they were ""New Great Taste!"" but curiously bad. Oh My Oh My, these are bad. Don't like them at all. AND they are Naturally and Artificially Flavored. Why did you ruin a good product? Could I trade you these ""New Great Taste! Same Punch!"" For some old really great taste and delicious, I can't even give them away, no one wants them once they taste them.To your new great taste ... I say NO THANKS, I'm done with Altoids if this is your way of changing a good product. You show the old box on your web site but that is NOT what is now in the store!They are way stronger than the US dollar at the moment. If uncle keeps borrowing money, mints can remain curiously supreme.By the way, my favorite is ""Ginger"" but of the mints, it WAS Spearmint."
1,Works great if you don't need to adjust it.,"Like many other reviewers, I'm having the same issue with this; the arm can't support the shower head. It was great for a few months but after adjusting and readjusting the shower head a few times, the shower head won't stay put."
1,Not as good as they should be...,"Why is the Altoid/Wrigley company using deceptive advertising??? Why are you using the old Spearmint Altoids CAN in your advertising and then selling everyone the (NEW) not as flavorful tasting spearmint altoids??? This should be illegal...wait, it is...it's called Bait & Switch.Spearmint Altoids have been great for years. But, my recent purchase of two 12 packs have left me severally disapointed in the product.. DON'T PURCHASE spearmint altoids with the yellow banner across the top that says ""New Great Taste! Same Punch!"". They have very very little spearmint flavor.They look the same, but taste like the original altoids with just a hint of spearmint flavor. Why the trickery?"
1,Not very well made,"Of course it works great - for as long as it works. After some time, my unit develped a leak. Unlike better showerheads, the part connecting the head to the hose is assembled in two pieces that separate after time, causing the seals to not set properly, resulting in the kind of leak mine developed. Unless you want to replace your showerhead every couple of years, I'd stay away fom this model. And good luck navigating Watrepik's website to get any help."
1,needs a better arm,"We bought and returned one of these.The positioning arm will not stay put. Shame too cos the water it puts out is VERY nice and the rinse more intense setting is great for washing long hair.Even though we don't adjust for height in our house, I hit the darn thing a few times with the towel (throwing towel over glass door) and it takes like 10 mins to get it to stay up again.Had to return it that is a no go.I was surprised that even though it was positioned higher than the shower door, becasue the spray is downward....water did not go outside the shower."
1,never got to try it...,"I am in disbelief this thing ever got marketed. The first time I attached the flexible hose it would not hold up the weight of the shower head. I tried tightening it, twisting it, you name it no good. It hangs down at a 30 -60 degree angle at best. I thought perhaps with water flowing through it things might improve. Nope. Just got worse. The engineering team on this one should be fired. This product should get the bonehead design of the year award. How the heck something like this ever got produced really blows my mind. Waterpik -it's coming back to you."
1,I don't understand the hype,"I just purchased some of these mints at the store. They don't have that great of a taste and they aren't strong at all until you bite into them, and then the mint flavor quickly disappears and doesn't leave your mouth minty in the least bit. I don't know where all these high reviews are coming from. They taste like cheap mints in my opinion. I've had better."
1,YOU HAVE RUINED THE SPEARMINT,"The traditional spearmint Altoids were excellent. The ""new"" flavor does not use oil of spearmint, having substituted artificial flavors instead. Bring back the oil of spearmint! Otherwise I will not be buying your mints again. I only liked the spearmint, and you have ruined it. Doubtless this is a money-inspired move. Shame on you."
1,Nope. Not a fan.,"I found these to be a waste of my money.I used them (well, attempted to) to mount a small (8x10), light weight (dunno- less than half a pound?) white board in my office, on the wall. Yes, I followed the directions. I was not pleased when said white board fell off the wall and on my head in the middle of a meeting. Undeterred, I used MORE squares to re-mount the white board. Same result. Head, meeting, disappointment.Went to the hardware store on my way home and scored some Duck Brand mounting squares. Worked much, much better. Also, unrelated bonus- their mascot is cuter. http://www.amazon.com/Duck-Brand-297472-Mounting-60-Count/dp/B000BQL2HS/ref=sr_1_14?ie=UTF8&qid;=1328642362&sr;=8-14"
1,Buyers remorse,"I figured if I spent three thousand dollars (That's right, $3000.00) on some wind chimes that my life would be perfect. I was wrong. I can't believe I fell for it! I should have known better. Stupid me I guess."
1,very dull book,"this is the worst book i have ever read,,it is very dull and unuseful..i9 bought it because i have read about the popularity of the surgeon who wrote it. i wish i can return it and get a refund..but i have threogh it in the trash"
1,Not For Me,I think Dr Oz is a fantastic doctor and I have heard him speak on tv but I did not find any useful information in this book for my life.
1,faulty,"the colors clip was way to flimsy and easy to break. it snapped right off, the colar was a waste of money."
1,Bad,"How can I trust a doctor like Ornish who doesn't admit that a low or better no fat diet is unhealthy, even more when studies and researches demonstrate that the countries with the lowest heart disease are France and Italy? The Mediterranean diet has a normal percentage of healthy fats, like the ones in olive oil and fish.What does he say about fish? ""You might say, well, why not eat fish, because then you can get the fish oil directly from the fish. And you can. The problem is that the fish with the highest amount of omega 3 fatty acids are also the highest in fat and cholesterol""....so.....his answer is to take pills instead of eating healthy fish 3 times a week with a big salad!!! And I can't understand how a doctor like Oz who suggests to eat fish for Omega 3 had decided to collaborate with somebody suggesting exactly the opposite."
1,Bad for your pets,"This is essentially poison that hangs around your cats neck. It's very dusty, it'll basically get on everywhere, and my cat got out of it within a minute of getting it put on him and tried to lick it (which means, death).I threw these away, and started to search for more natural way of getting rid of fleas. I ended up getting a flea brush and brush them for a week straight, then gave them bath, and just repeated that process. I know it's a big hassle, but I'd rather put in a little work, and my cat be alive, then I'd be lazy and my cat be dead.Waste of money but good lesson learned. Read some of the things that people post up regarding the flea collars."
1,Very helpful,"This book by Dr Oz was very helpful, everyone should read it and apply it to yourself. He explains in easy to understand words about the dangers of your heart."
1,Broke During Assembly,"I wish I was able to have luck with this item. When we were putting it together, the leg split right in half as we were putting a screw in. I've returned it and am trying a different brand."
1,"Do not like "" New Great Taste - Same Punch"" labeled Spearmint Tins!!","I have to say after getting two tins of these New Recipe Spearmints, I will not be buying Altoids anymore. I cannot believe you went from Natural Oil of Spearmint to ""Natural and Artificial Flavors"". I cannot stand this new flavor and Callard & Bowser you have lost me unless you bring back the ""The Original Celebrated"" Spearmint recipe. The new flavor is aweful and bites back.This is very sad. I hope you wake up and realize the All Natural was the way it was meant to be. Leave the original recipe alone!"
1,"""New & Improved Spearmint????"" NO WAY!!!!","This ""New & Improved Spearmint"" has obvious chemical flavor additives...which to me similar to peppermint. If I wanted peppermint, I would buy it! Also...who needs to ingest more chemicals? Our bodies arn't made for man made chemicals! It's a shame that Wrigley's took a good product & made is detestable![...]"
1,New Great Taste--Not so great--in fact pretty bad,"Spearmint altoids have been my favorite for years. My local stores have not had them much lately, so I was thrilled to be able to get them online.Wow....how disappointing.They tasted so awful with a very artificial type of flavor.I have also recently bought the wintergreen and peppermint, and these are still pretty good.But why did they have to go messing with the spearmint!!I hope they go back to the Old great taste."
1,"""Improved"" flavor.","The new flavor is completely awful. ""New and improved"" is code for ""now using artificial flavoring that doesn't taste like spearmint"". Stock up if you can find the originals and avoid the new ones; they're gross."
1,YUK!!!!,"If there were a lower rating than 1 star, this ""New Great Taste"" for Altoids Spearmints would deserve it. They are horrible; having no relation to a real spearmint flavor at all. Still green, but that's about all you can say. What a disappointment!"
1,Experi-mint in Terror,"I recently restocked my supply to discover a banner on the box announcing a change in flavor. Bleagh! The once addictive spearmint Altoids taste like a cut-rate wintergreen. Did I say bleagh? Bleagh!I'd hate to see nearly three decades of Altoids pleasure come to an end, but these are just plain lousy, now."
1,"Blah, ugly, and shower chills","It does function, but I can't say anything else pleasant about this shower head. It is ugly, it is very hard to adjust the height (stiff arm, limited ROM) and it has a small circumference of water that rains down with low pressure. You can find something way better for the money. Keep looking. I made my boyfriend take it back."
1,Turn around and run,"I had one for about 7 years, yes it worked great, until one day it broke and would not stay up. I ordered one just like it, when it came I put it on and used the shower one time and it did not want to stay up very good. Then my wife was taking a shower and all of all sudden it broke and would not stay up at all. We did not get two showers out of it. Will NOT order a nother one. 30 some dollars down the drain."
1,Poorly designed piece of junk!,"The flex neck on this product is so weak & poorly designed it won't hold up the showerhead. This means in order to take a shower you have to stand under it, hold the head up with one hand & wash with the other. Otherwise it will fall down & hit you on the head! This could probably be remedied by installing it as handheld, but that requires an adaptor shown in the product instructions. Problem is Amazon doesn't carry them, I can't find one at any retailers carrying Waterpic & it's not even shown on the shower accessory page of Waterpics's own website! This piece of junk is going back tomorrow & I'll get a rain showerhead worth owning!"
1,Mints a disaster,"I have bought the old Spearmint Altoids and they had a wonderful flavor. The new Spearmint Altoids are terrible. You cannot tell the difference between the new spearmint, peppermint and wintergreen mints.Altoids needs to investigate why the New Spearmint does not come close to tasting like Spearmint. I would have been better off just buying Spearmint Tic Tacks."
1,A BIG disappoint-mint!,"These have always been my favorite mint...not just for the refreshing REAL taste, but for the fact that while the rest of the mint world seemed to cave under the pressure to put all types of carcinogenic and toxic ARTIFICIAL chemicals and sweeteners in their gum, candy and mints, this company still maintained the integrity of their ingredients! Then, one day, Wrigleys decides to throw integrity out the window! The only recipe they have yet to ruin is the Peppermint Altoids, but everyone knows the original flavors were so much better! We don't care that they are white! I, for one, do not choose my mints by their color, and since these mainly cater to adults, why not put back the good ingredients, so these don't fade into the woodwork with the rest of the artificial imposters! Then, those of us who care what we put into our bodies, can raise our children and grandchildren on them, and the tradition will live on! :)"
1,"Looks good, but...","This product looks good but we found it to be a general dissappointment. Despite installation that included teflon tape, we could never get it to stop leaking. Also, we could never get the shower head into a comfortable position and get it to stay put. The biggest problem had to do with hard water. Although we don't have exceptionally hard water, we had to have it replaced twice in two years. The switch stopped working and we had water continually coming out of both settings. On a good note, Waterpik was very accomodating about the product warranty. I think we'll go back to something simpler and less expensive."
1,Waterpik CF-201 Cascadia Drenching Rain Showerhead,"Awful, like the others said, IT SAGS! It won't stay where you put it, after a while the different settings stop working, Waterpik has a great return policy but after a while you get tired of dealing with it."
1,Doesn't Last,"I have been using this showerhead for about a year now. At first I quite liked it. However, lately it does not switch properly between modes. Sometimes it is half and half, sometimes it dribbles out the middle. This is disappointing and means I have to replace it. I believe a showerhead should last more than a year and will no longer buy any waterpik products."
1,A Sagging Disappointment,"It looks really cool, BUT end up being very disappointing. The head is too heavy and sags during the shower from I would guess the weight of the water. During my shower, it eventually sags until it touches the top of my head. I push it back up and 5 minutes later, it hits my head again. Very frustrating. I removed it after 2 weeks of this game."
1,Handle broke after one month.,The plastic connector from the handle to the latch mechanism broke without warning one month after installation. Beware of imitations. This is not a genuine Nissan part.
1,Cheap materials ruin this product,"In a word this is junk. The flexible arm is too weak to support the large rainfall head. From day one it wanted to droop down and not stay in place. If I managed to get it in the desired position it only took the slightest touch to make it fall back down - forget about the button for spray selection. It's very disappointing considering I had an older ""gooseneck"" shower head from Waterpik that worked without any issues, but it seems they decided to go with a cheap design that renders this product essentially unusable."
1,Gross!!!,This grows mold because all the water does not drain out of it after each shower. Too gross! Don't buy- we are replacing ours asap.
1,HORRIBLE,I didn't even have the shower head for 24 hours and the neck of it broke.Save your money and get something else.
1,Misleading book title,This book has almost nothing to do about rifles. It is about double barrel shotguns. The title implies that this is a book about rifles. I feel it is misleading and deceptive.
1,Dissapointing,A very comprehensive study of each and every season Butkus played with the Bears. But I was hoping for much more about Butkus's life off the football field. I would have liked to have heard more anecdotes about players he played with and against. Also would have been interesting to hear personal insights from Dick regarding what he felt about the awe-like reputation he inspired on the field from fans and players alike.This reads too much as a season-by-season and game-by-game account of his career. Interesting at first but repetitive and dry over time. I was hoping for more.
1,Love the history; this printing did not include some pages.,"I was thoroughly enjoying skimming through the book for old ideas in household gadgets, clothing and such, when I looked specifically for ""kit houses."" It was not mentioned, but ""house"" was - on a page that was not printed in this edition. I began from the beginning of the book and found countless pages not printed. Page 21 was on the back of 24, 27 was on the back of 34, and so on. That was very disappointing, which is why I slashed the rating. Did these pages get included in newer reproductions? I'd like to see what was missing. And I would love to see a description of kit houses and how much they went for in those days."
1,Miserable quality,"These so-called adapters are of such poor quality, it is not worth your few dollars to get them, even with Prime. They are not milled to the standard 3.5mm plug spec, and you may run into the problem I did, which is that it ruined the device I plugged into. I'm handy with the soldering iron, so I will be able to fix it, but this purchase will cost me more to repair the damage than I saved by not getting the Monster adapter."
1,Doesn't work at all,"I have hearing lost in one ear, so I was attempting to to get stereo sound into just one side of my headset. Disabling one doesn't enable mono sound, thats been established many time online. Anyway, I got this product hoping i could do that. But it doesn't even work at all. Zero sound."
1,Boring!,"My son was excited to get this game for Christmas, but after playing it one time was disappointed. Not worth the cost of the game."
1,A fair historical recounting heavily diluted by personal memoirs,"Mr. Leschak writes quite well, I think. But, as was stated in other reviews, unless you have a real interest in wildfire fighting from a ""line boss"" point of view, this effort is less about Peshtigo and firefighting than it is about Mr. Leschak's personal spiritual journey and his finding personal fulfillment leading a fire crew. He is quite unapologetic about his disavowal of all things religious, having become quite immersed in his own revelation as it relates to the natural world.What he does share about Peshtigo is enlightening and very absorbing. It is not as wanting as some might think, and the author ties in his own personal spiritual turmoil with the Catholic priest's encounter with the fury of nature (or is it an act of judgment?). Unfortunately, what one does read about the Peshtigo fire is about what you'd expect in a magazine story; just enough to whet your appetite for more."
1,"Horrible, and honestly a bit propagandist.","This game is really just not fun. Unless you really embrace the roles you are given in the instructions, money grubbing jerk for monopolists valiant defender of the free market for the competitors, I don't really see how you can enjoy yourself. My wife and I were both very excited to give it a try, but that hope decreased rapidly as we read through the instructions and ran out before we made it around the board even one time."
1,the WORST board game ever,"I bought this game for my brother as a Christmas present because I thought it sounded intriguing. It turned out to be the worst Christmas present ever. My brother hated it so much he started screaming and throwing the game pieces across the room. If you're looking to buy a board game please, please, please, please, please, please don't pick this one.The point of the game is that you can choose to be a competitor or a monopolist, and there are different rules for each. Unlike with the other reviewers, to us the game seemed rigged against the monopolists. But whether it's rigged against the monopolists or the competitors, who wants to play a game that's rigged?"
1,Teaches an Erroneous Lesson,"Unfortunately, this entire game is based upon a false premise and thus teaches an erroneous lesson. The game itself is a market. And a given market breaks down into one of 3 categories: Monopoly, Oligopoly(Limited Competition), or Panopoly(Full/Open-Competition). The original game itself actually starts as an oligopoly or panopoly, with price fixing(READ: Government subsidy or regulation), and the objective of becoming a monopoly.You cannot have a monopoly faction competing against a competitive faction. If this games illustrates anything, it illustrates the detrimental effect of government regulation subsidizing one faction of a market, and forcing another faction to compete against them. Which in the real world and in the game, as the other reviews have also largely indicated, kills competition."
1,MALISIMA!!!! NO PIERDAN SU DINERo,"Lo peor de lo peor, mal aprovechado el tiempo en verla!!!! Hueca, vacia, sin humor, mas de lo mismo, el gordito tonto y chistoso( pero en esta movie hizo la excepcion, no era gracioso para NADA!) el tonto enamorado( sobreactuadisimo!!!) y el de dinero que era el winner!! :(..... . la pelicula salta de cuadro en cuadro, no es correlativa, hay mucho silencio entre lineas, falta de experiencia y malisimos actores!!!!!!! NO LA VEAN!!!!! MUCHO MENOS LA RENTEN NI COMPREN!!!!!"
1,"Shotguns, not American Hunting Rifles",Mostly about shotguns. Not American hunting riles. I guess this English publisher thinks shotguns are rifles.
1,Disappointed,"I was VERY disappointed with this book because it was recommended as a good account of the Peshtigo fire; yet, what the author actually had to say about this event could have fit into less than one chapter. I could not, however, justify giving it only one star as what he did say about the fire was interesting. This book would probably be read with great interest by those excited by helicopters and/or fighting wildfires as these are the real focuses of this book. Time after time, when I expected the author to really get into the Peshtigo fire, I was dismayed once again to find he once again goes into a long litany about himself which seems to be his true obsession. I got very tired of his self-praise and importance, his use of ""big words"" - as though to impress when plain language would have suited better, his over-emphasis on descriptive phrasing, and incomplete sentences! If you want to read about the Peshtigo fire, don't bother with this book."
1,Mostly just perversion,"""Decapitator Asa"" is a sword tester and executioner for the shogun. This is the premise. It is an excuse to explore the tales of violence, sex, and perversion that have led criminals to the chopping block, so to speak. The illustration in uncolored pen and ink is mediocre. Not sure what the deal is with these strange period dramas set in the Edo period, like Hanzo the Razor, too. I'm always a sucker for sword and sandal epics, East or West, but skimmed this one just to see what the series is like. Not that enjoyable and don't care about the characters."
1,i got a huge bottle from costco,"this stuff tastes NASTY. the ingredients look similar to some Filipino adobo marinades(mostly soy sauce), but the flavor is mostly salty(its mostly made for soy sauce)sour/bitter earthy. avoid this product, protect your toungeother thought- what kind of sauce is made out of another sauce?"
1,What could be more boring than a fishing show?,"Sure, it was supposed to be a spoof on a fishing show. Imagine creating a home movie that spoof's your grandmother doing laundry and petting the cat. You wouldn't waste your time... which begs to question why these guys did. Willem Dafoe manages to once again bring a brilliant performance to an otherwise graham cracker production. I wouldn't return it to Amazon, but if John showed up at my doorstep and apologized, I would gladly accept. It gets two stars, because I reserve the 1 star rating for anything with Bill Paxton."
1,Worst BBQSauce,"This is hands down, the worst BBQ sauce we've ever had, there is really no other way to say it.We purchased a 73oz bottle from our local Costco and it ruined our BBQ, very disappointed."
1,Pure garbage,"It never ceases to amaze me how idiots can enjoy crappy film making like this, and rate it as excellent, filled with humor, etc., etc. Lurie is an idiot, who brings out the same in his guests. If that passes for humor today, then so be it. Lurie laughed all the way to the bank. I'm ever so glad that I previewed it on YouTube and did not pay for it. Unbelievable, pure garbage and a waste of time, spent with people who are full of themselves for no good reason."
1,Nothing About Fishing,This movie should come with a warning label that indicates it has NOTHING to do with fishing. Both the host of the show and the stars know absolutly nothing about the topic in the title...that of fishing. They do everything else but fish. The voice over throughout the movie is done in a monotone and flat voice that is supposed to be funny but is more annoying than anything else. If you are a fisherman or are thinking of this as a gift for a fisherman DO NOT buy this movie!!
1,What????,"I bought this for my dad's birthday. He is a fisherman. This movie is one of the worst I've ever seen. Not entertaining, not funny, not interesting, not even a fishing movie. I bought it based on several reviews I read. This is the first time I've been led astray on Amazon. The ""5 Stars"" rating must be a review by people with a financial interest in this waste of digital energy."
1,Yet another shameless self promotion from Playboy,"The only really worthwhile information I got from this book was about the coat hangers. The rest of the book is littered with the same self important tripe Playboy is famous for. Anything for another buck. If you want to know how pygmy s use goat eyelashes for sex, or the dozen plus different definitions of Venus butterfly then buy this book. If you actual want to improve your love life try sitting down and TALKING to your partner.Playboy does not more know about your own sex life than you do."
1,Marginal,"While the book has some interesting ideas in it, I was appalled at a handful of them, such as #59 (putting an Alka Seltzer in a woman's vagina) and #104 (geting head while driving a car). I would never place a carbonated item inside a woman's vagina, nor would I want to be receiving oral sex while trying to drive! Ideas like these, despite the author's claims to the contrary are plain dangerous.The comment on one trick that ""large-breasted women are more sexually experienced than smaller breasted women"" also bothered me. Does the author or the person who came up with that trick know this from personal experience? I certainly haven't found this to be true in my own experiences.If you're looking for ways to spice up your sex life, there are numerous other books out there to read, like the Sex Toy Tricks series by Jay Wiseman, Bondage On A Budget, or even the Sex for Dummies book.I'll pass on this one, thank you."
1,"Man, was I dissapointed!!","Some people say they like this book cus it's more real. I thinks that's stupid! It makes life look like something its not, like how everything goes wrong with the girls and their love life, PLEASE!! If you ask me the best Nacy Drew seires is Nancy Drew Files. In that seiris she does not seem to fake (like she sometimes did in the origanal books) yet I did not get deppresd like I did in this book. I mean com'on reading is for enjoyment!! Read the files they are sooooo much better she's older and more mature!! The Files still have love and stuff, but don't spend half the book talking about it. Read the Files!!! (my opinion, some people think differently!!)"
1,Too much b.s.,"The chapter on thinking was intriguing, even though there was a taste of b.s. I looked forward to it getting better, or at least providing some additional help. Instead, it went rapidly downhill, talking about ""moods"" as if they came out of the blue -- and it actually got worse, because it was like someone flogging an already dead horse (his point) to prove he can resurrect it."
1,Useless Skinsations,I have tried this product on two occasions. Despite repeated applications the mosquitoes just kept biting. It isn't worth the price.
1,To Big!!!,"Bought this to use in my damaged iPhone 4, which only plays right side, but when I finally got it the adapter was slightly larger than 3.5mm and would not fit. Waste of money."
1,Not original recordings...,"I think the only original recording is ""Sweet Old-Fashioned Girl."" She does a good job on the others, but for those who won't accept anything less than the originals, this isn't for you."
1,"Dated, and cheap 50's pop muzak...","This is middle of the road pop music from the 50's at it's worst. Compare anything Teresa Brewer did to any talented singers like Ella Fitzgerald, Anita O'Day, or even Rosemary Clooney, or Doris Day. Teresa Brewer belongs in the category of talentlass hacks like Patti Page and Andy Williams. Stay away from this dated muzak."
1,Not anywhere near as good as other Altoids flavors,"Being a mint snob, I constantly am on the lookout for new varieties of coolness to what may already be a lifetime mint addiction. So disappointed that this new Spearmint Altoids is nowhere near Altoids Ginger or Cinnamon flavors. You pop it into your mouth, expecting either the distinctive spice of spearmint or the full-on blast of a regular mint, and on both counts it falls short. It neither belongs to the ""Curiously Strong"" or the ""naturally-flavored"" categories; it falls somewhere in the middle of the pack. All I get in my mouth is the refreshing feel of artificiality that quickly wears out in a few minutes. You'd be better off buying generic mints. Big taste fail."
1,"New taste, much worse","Sorely disappointed in the new taste. Change for the worse, very much so. Not buying Altoids in light of this."
1,This is pure dross,The entire X-Men history of thirty years has been destroyed in one pathetically constructed alternate reality.
1,FIX spearmint Altoids!,"The original spearmint Altoids flavor was my favorite flavor. The ""new and improved"" version is quite nasty in comparison. Please bring back the original spearmint flavor!"
1,"New ""improved"" flavor is AWFUL!!!","Spearmint Altoids were my favorite for years. When local stores quit stocking them, I began ordering them on-line. How disappointing it was to receive the new ""improved"" flavored Spearmint Altoids. They're AWFUL! I can't believe they would take their best product (in my opinion) and totally trash it. Please bring back the original Spearmint Altoids. PLEASE!!!"
1,NASTY!!,"Tastes as if they colored the peppermint Altoids green...Stronger than original and definitely NOT spearmint-flavored! Original had pleasant, mildly sweet taste. Haven't we learned from Coca-Cola to leave well enough alone??"
1,Product not as described.,My package did not contain VB 2005. It contained Visual Web Developer.Microsoft subsequently sent me the VB 2005 CD.VB 2005 will NOT import my VB 6.0 project file. Will have to re-write the program in VB 2005. Very disappointed.
1,Microsoft Visual Basic Express,"The product was shipped with the correct book, but with a disk containing the wrong information. I contacted Microsoft, but received an unacceptable response. I was instructed to contact Amazon. However, since the package was sealed and the disk label said Visual Basic, I thought it was ridiculous to assume that Amazon had done anything wrong. After several unproductive exchanges with the Microsoft complaint department, I gave up and downloaded the necessary files from the internet. My service from Amazon was very good. My service from microsoft was unacceptable."
1,Order the book and get the same program for FREE,"It's amazing to think that anyone would buy this program when it can be downloaded from the Microsoft site for free. If you need a CD, then order Microsoft's book, ""Build a Program Now!, Microsoft Visual Basic 2005 Express Edition"" by Patrice Pelland for about a third of the price. The CD comes with the complete program.The two stars are for sticking it to the consumer and does not reflect on VB Express itself. The program is quite good and an excellent way to get started with programming--especially with the ""Build a Program Now!"" book."
1,"DO NOT BUY THE ""NEW GREAT TASTE"" Spearmint Altoids","Just tried the ""new great taste""-labeled Spearmint Altoids and they are HORRIBLE. For some reason, the Oil of Spearmint has been removed and replaced with artificial flavoring. These don't even taste like spearmint..."
1,Not Again,"I love spearmint, so I was intrigued when I read all the bad reviews on the ""New and Improved"" Altoids Spearmint. How bad could they be, I thought? Especially when the other Altoids flavors are 1st rate. The answer to ""How bad could they be?"" is ""VERY!"" I'm not exactly sure what flavor these are. I know it says spearmint on the tin, but they taste more like winter-pepper-spear-cina-mysterymint. I wish I had tasted the original Altoids Spearmints before they were tinkered with. Obviously it was a financial decision on the part of the company to mess with the formula: fake flavoring is always cheaper than the real thing. But why these companies are so shortsighted is beyond me. In this instance, a penny gained is another customer lost. Stupid."
1,Short-Changed,"9 episodes of D&D for $9? Do yourself a favor and fork over $5 more for the complete 27 episode version... unless your a completist, the picture disc IS different for this release (it contains the title ""The Animated Series, Beginnings"" and has a cool world map, a layout of the land -- Tolkien style). It does not even remotely compare to the $40 BCI edition with all of the extras; and remastered, espcially in comparison that it's missing the other 18 episodes. This introduction DVD version, played on my Blu-ray player couldn't even help color-correct this edition; parts would be 'bright' and then all of a sudden wash-out and get dull; at approximately 3 hours and 18 minutes, it felt awfully compressed. The sound is great; the packaging is ultra strange, a huge clam case that holds... one envelope."
1,go back to the old recipe,"I have to agree with Bob Trombone. I am so disappointed with the new Spearmint Altoids. Having searched for a couple of weeks for them, I was overjoyed to find them, only to be disappointed. Please go back to the old recipe!!!"
1,Not so Spearmint.,"The Spearmint Altoids do not taste like spearmintat all. They taste just like the peppermint ones.Someone ought to tell them that there is a difference between peppermint and spearmint.I hate peppermint. I bought these because the tin clearly says ""SPEARMINT - New Great Taste"" on it.Even for the amount of money I paid, they still should refund it.They suck."
1,New Altoids Spearmint,"Altoids Spearmint has been my favorite mint for many years. It has become increasingly hard to find the Spearmint tins here though. I will usually buy several tins whenever I can find them, not knowing when I will find them again. I finally ran out of my supply and went looking for a refill. I was able to find them at CVS. I noticed the label said NEW GREAT TASTE.....Well, I won't exactly say YUCK, but these no longer taste like Spearmint at all. I don't know what they are using as a substitute for their original Spearmint oil, but is is a VERY POOR substitute. I now have two tins of these mints to eat. They are edible, but nothing I would buy again. Such a shame ! ! !"
1,Major Disappointment,"... I was thrilled with the vocabulary levels, plot devices, and character depictions in the original series (I read #3, ""The Bungalow Mystery""), and fairly impressed also with the ""Nancy Drew Files"". However, the ""On Campus"" series is a travesty. It is a sensationalized,... and dumbed-down version of a classic series. ..."
1,Tales of the Kingdom Hardcover,"I was a bit disappointed when I received this book in the mail and flipped through it. One of the pages was scribbled with a significant amount of green marker, and another couple pages had crayon ""drawings"" on them. This was not listed in the review, and I was sad to find that the review didn't match the quality of the actual product.Besides this flaw, the book is absolutely amazing. I love to read it myself and have enjoyed sharing it with others."
1,Move along...,"I am an avid reader of Julia Alvarez. I collect first-editions of her novels and poetry collections.However, I had to force myself to finish this one. I thoroughly enjoyed the story of Isabel but each time one of her chapters would end, I'd suffer through another one about Alma. I'd put down the book for days on end and have to make myself pick it up again.I'd love to see Alvarez try again and write a story about the Spanish Royal Philanthropic Expedition with nothing else to distract from it.If you're interested in Julia Alvarez, try ""In the Time of Butterflies"" or ""Garcia Girls"" instead. Skip this one."
1,Definitely skip this one,"The so-called hero is a brute and a bully. At one point he attempts to starve his wife into bending to his rule. They hate each other until the very last page of the book, when they suddenly, and totally unconvincingly, declare their undying love! Give me a break!"
1,BORING!,"I have never felt so inspired to write a review. I generally feel obligated to finish books that I purchase, but I am really struggling with this one. I am an avid reader and have probably read close to 8 books in the last 3 months. Some of them very enjoyable. However......"
1,Tedius and Wordy -- What Was I Thinking,"This novel goes on and on and on. The protagonist is self-absorbed, the characters mostly sketched rather than developed. Alvarez offers one stereotype after another. There may be themes buried in all the blah blah, but I am finding them hard to detect. Alvarez has issues with the publishing industry. Who doesn't? This is one of the worst purchases I have made in a long time."
1,Uh-uh!!,"I purchased this book, thinking that it would be as good as the originals- and I was wrong. This (no offense, anybody, I just don't like it) trashes Nancy and Ned's relationship- I consider it downright stupid. For those of you who want Nancy and Ned to stay together, don't bother with this one."
1,Wrong adapter.,"The pictured adapter looks like and the ad describes it as a stereo female and mono male. I received the reverse, i.e., a stereo male and mono female!! I misplaced the paperwork and could not contact the vendor so they could replace the item with the correct adapter. How can this matter be taken care of??"
1,What happened?,"I agree with Jessica Cook. Nancy Drew changed! Why did Carolyn Keene start to write this, what I think, horrible series? The originals were the best, then she did the Nancy Drew files and they were pretty good. But in this series, Nancy and every single other character has changed!!!(I'm writing this after I've read all of the ones published.) Burt and Dave are gone. You're not believe going to believe what happens between Nancy and Ned, and there really are no mysteries! It's become one of the things I hate most, a soap opera! I apologize if anyone is offended, but I think Carolyn Keene should have stopped after the Nancy Drew Files."
1,A little disappointed...,"I am an avid Nancy Drew reader and I was looking for some material for older kids to try. I bought this one and was a little disappointed with it. First of all, the plot was a little amature. I mean stealing? And second of all, the fact that Nancy just ditched Ned was a little mean! You can't just drop a couple after they were together for practicaly the whole series. That's just what I thought of it."
1,bad price on below average product,these undersized and overpriced packets of miso soup has additives like 'dry fish powder' and i did not notice the small print of ingrediants before buying and accepting shipment. i have other products ordered through amazon that are great and repeatedly shipped to my door but this product is inferior and i wish i could get a refund on unused and still sealed portion.
1,Another Hate Filled Book from the Christian Right,"The Christian Right and Conservative Religions (as a human organization) by their very principles has always been a convenient land for right-wing authoritarians to stake their arguments against change. This has played out in every single human rights struggle pretty much ever. This books is a classic example of this syndrome, it's lies, it's misrepresentations... It is reminicent of the type of propaganda put out by Joseph Goebbels."
1,Rednecks can write??,"This book was the most homophobic, intolerant book I have ever laid my eyes upon. The Authors of this atrocity need to realize that there are some people in this country who aren't Christian, and don't want to be oppressed by your religious rulings.If you don't like homosexuals (someone who is born with a biological, hormonal imbalance in their brain and who is not prone to a choice on sexuality) then you can sit at home and complain about it with all your intolerant friends.Acceptance, please."
1,"This is My One Commandment,","This is my one commandment, That ye love one another as I have loved you. John 15.12.Listen to Him, no him."
1,Amazingly stupid--one wonders why it was written.,I can hardly believe I finished reading this book as every page was more stupid than the previous one. I am not a regular reader of Danielle Steel but read them when given to me. If the author has future ideas of writing more of this kind I will not bother to read them even though they are free. A complete waste of time and energy.
1,This Must Be A Joke,This has got to be the stupidest book I have ever read. I cannot believe it was published and am very upset I paid money for it.
1,"Silly, But Entertaining","No one dies, as they do in most Steele novels, but ""Klone"" is entertaining anyhow. Recommend as an audio listen, not as a read."
1,NO STARS,"steph believes her husband leaves her after thirteen years of marriage because of her boring flannel night gowns and unshaved legs. in the meantime, she meets peter and quickly falls in love. peter is into bionics and while he goes away on business trips, he leaves behind his clone, paul to keep his girlfriend company. steph is torn because she finds herself in love with both peter and paul. when she's not having sex with peter, she's doing sexual acrobatics with paul.the whole story line is utterly ridiculous. the only reason i finished the book was because i was hoping it would get better.i kept thinking this would make some kind of comedy. unfortunately, i don't think danielle steel had comedy in mind when she wrote it. i do believe the reader was supposed to get sucked into a romantic love triangle. that didn't happen! instead, i continued to dislike steph's insecure, sex crazed character less and less."
1,The Worst Book I have ever read...,"There is no way I can discribe just how bad this book is. I finished the book thinking the plot has to be a dream or something the lead charactor had, and possibly it could be redeemed. No such luck, it's just a horrible story.The woman in the book should have had her kids removed from her household by CPS. She allows a drunk klone to stay in her house.Totally stupid. The charactors are all shallow and unlikable. The only thing that is good about this book is the the ending, because then you no longer have to suffer through this awful story."
1,Read on the beach-of all places,Read this in one day while sitting on the beach! What a confusing endin
1,Actually I'd rate it a minus 10.....,"Without a doubt the absolute worst book I have ever been stupid enough to buy. Intrigued by the incorrect grammar and spelling of the title, I picked it up on a quick run through the grocery store -- and should have left it there. Ms. Steel is clearly desperate to sell -- and quality be damned. She used to weave a pretty good tale, all variations on a theme and totally predictable but the stories made for a good read on a plane trip or a day at the beach. This one is an absolute embarrassment and she should be thoroughly ashamed."
1,The worst Danielle Steele I have ever read.,I have read a majority of her books and this just barely rates. The lead character of Stephanie is such a wimp that I wanted to slap her. I should have believed all the reviews that I read and not bothered to purchase it.
1,A SENSELESS STORY,"THIS BOOK WAS A FAST READ AND VERY SILLY,SOMETHING YOU WOULD READ BECAUSE YOU JUST DON'T HAVE ANYTHING ELSE TO DO."
1,far-fetched,This book is an insult to the readers intelligence. How Did Danielle Steele come up with this idea?
1,I hope they don' make this into a movie!,"I read DS once a year on vacation while sitting on the beach. This year I am sorry I did. This was the worse book I've ever read. A waste of time and money. I will never pick up a one of her books to read again. What was she thinking???? If I could have rated this a minus star, I would."
1,"Very different, very unlike Danielle Steele",Though I enjoyed it like all the others I found it a little too far fetched and a little hard to believe. They way she normally writes you can see the whole setting and picture the characters easily. This was harder to imagine.
1,Not up to her standard,"I have read every book she has written and I think that this has to be the worse book she has written. I am sorry that I bought it, and more sorry that I wasted by time reading it. I had to finish it because I couldn't believe it was so bad!"
1,"A ""Klone"" must have written this book.",I was extremely disappointed in this book. I will not finish it. We want the real Danielle Steele back. Try again Danielle.
1,DISAPPOINTED!!!,"I have read all of Danielle Steel's books, but this book was a real waste of time and money. It just kept going around in circles. This was the first Danielle Steel book that I was dying to finish and not in a good way..."
1,Out in left field some where,"Half way threw the book, I almost put it down but I always finish a book no matter how stupid it is. This book was not up to danielle Steel's potential. It was a waste of money & time."
1,I think she needs a LONG vacation,"Before I begin, let me say I have been a fan of Danielle Steel since day one.... I am TRULY DISAPPOINTED IN THIS BOOK . I cannot even begin to think of what she was thinking when she wrote this book. IT WAS HORRIBLE. After reading THE LONG ROAD HOME which was my favorite she writes this piece of trash. The main character was really a first class tramp according to this book..going to bed with Peter and then his klone which is a MACHINE. Come on now are we hard up for a machine sex organ to keep us going???? I hope the next one is better......"
1,edgar cayce s predictions for the 21st century,"The book is good if you want to learn a version of meditation. Many of the predictions in the book were wrong, the events came and went. I have actually lost interest in Casey's work because of this book. No wow factor. I'll take a look at another book sometime in the future to regain my interest in Edgar Casey. An easy prediction for this book, it will not be a best seller."
1,A Big Waste of money,I have read every book Ms. Steel has written. I even took part of the grocery money this week to buy this book. What a waste of money and a waste of time to read it. I am surprised that Ms. Steel would even expect her readers to like this book.
1,Could've Been Better,"I'm a big fan Of Danielle Steel books. The Klone and I was okay but nowhere near comapre dot some of her other works. It actually seemed to get better as the book progressed though. I would say ""Read it - but do not get your hopes up"""
1,I didn't like this bo ok,"I used to take pride in the fact that I was a Steel fan, but I'm about to jump off the Steel band wagon. I was devasted by the clone and I. I wish this book would never have been published.-Nutcase"
1,A Second Disappointment,"I was disappointed in the previous book, and vowed not to read another non-Scarpetta novel. But, I ordered The Klone and Ibecause I decided to give Danielle Steel another chance. I was so disappointed."
1,A Second Disappointment,"Under most circumstances, I read a Steel novel in one evening -- but not this time. However, it was a completely different type of novel and had it been written by any author other than Steel, I probably would not have bought it. From now on, I'll just wait for the next novel. --3rd Tom"
1,Disappointed!!!,"I'd like to start this by saying that I'm a fan and am there to buy her books the minute they're available, and I was really looking forward to getting to know more about these new characters.. had enjoyed their arrival in her last book... but WAS SO DISAPPOINTED... it was never really developed and kind of ""I don't know"" what was she going for. from Emmet"
1,Worst book I have read,I have read a lot of books and I can clearly say that this is the worst book I have ever read in my life. Danielle steel really blew it this time.
1,Unreal and Unbelievable,"I found this book to be so unreal and unbelievable that it was hard for me to relate to the story. I felt detatched from the characters and even bored at times. I also thought the main character was a poor representation of a woman, especially for her love life."
1,Absolutely stupid,"I have been reading DS Books since I was a teen and this book didn't even seem like it was written by her. It feels like in the last 3-4 years DS has some sort of deadline to meet and a certian amount of books to write per year. This was like a fill-in book to keep you reading until she comes up with a good one. It was dumb, boring, and very predictable. Don't waste your time or money on this unless you need fire starter."
1,Disappointing,"I was extremely disappointed in this, Ms. Steele's latest book. Coming so soon after ""The Long Road Home"" made it that much more disappointing. The story line and characters are highly unbelievable."
1,Boring,"I got about half way through before deciding to turn this horrible film off. Upon reading some very positive reviews i decided to finish the rest. What a waste of time. I spent most of my time wondering if I was watching the same film as other reviewers. This movie is boring, and a complete waste of time. Its not funny at all, just completely lame. I would suggest watching anything else that you can find instead of this film. BTW, I am a big low budget b grade horror fan. This is just garbage. There is one decent scene at the end involving a hatchet and a chainsaw, but it is nothing special and is not worth watching the rest of the movie for."
1,DER HIT-MIX DAS ALBUM - ROLAND KAISER,"Roland Kaiser's voice and Music are still a joy to listen to, the CD is very disapointing. They cramed 32 songs ( short versions ) on one CD. It's something if you want to open a Disco and have a Roland Kaiser evening. I buy my Music because of my long commute to/from work. This is not a joy to listen to. I have to buy a new CD, that I can have the complete versions, and can enjoy, now I am out the money for this one. I paid 16.49. I would have been happy to pay an extra $ 5.00 to get a double CD set with the complete versions."
1,Doesn't hold well,"I was trying to mount a relatively light plastic bag holder to the inside of my kitchen cabinet. The previous mounting tape did a good job, but was ripped off. I bought the Duck because it has a good name brand... and was REALLY disappointed. It barely had any sticking power at all."
1,Doesn't hold anything but won't come off wall,"I've bought this previously at local stores, it wouldn't hold light weight wooden letters, repeatedly had them falling off the walls, as well as extremely light music posters, simply had no gripping strength whatsoever. Now here's the kicker, when I went to remove the tape from the wall it won't come off! It sticks to the wall but not to anything else! The gray foam leaves a gray residue if not pieces of the tape when you take it off. Save yourself the trouble and buy a different product."
1,It use to be a great cleaner,I use to go thru these cans alot until they started using something that makes it milky white like 2% milk). Now I have to go over it again to clean the haze off. I won't be buying this anymore. Double work! Why mess with it if it was already a great product!
1,make the connection,"Having read perhaps sixty or seventy books concerning quantum phenomena, I was eager to enlarge my horizons with this one. Now that I have read it twice, I am still searching for some indication that the author has found a connection between theology (I grant him expertise in this) and quantum anything. In fact, though it is merely implicit, he makes the naive error of considering the quantum as something large, when semi-informed lay readers know that the quantum is the smallest measurable amount of energy. thebigo@gte.net"
1,"A bold mixture of deceit, drivel, and dogma","O'Murchu claims to have reached a synthesis of religion and science, including the ""new physics"" of quantum mechanics (hence the title). This is an interesting idea, but the author of a book such as this needs to have background in both physics and theology, and O'Murchu has little to say about classical theology and no knowledge of any kind of science. The list of scientists he has consulted is impressive (including David Bohm, Stephen Hawking, and Paul Davies), but it would appear that he threw out everything they told him; the book is filled with misinformation and outright lies about quantum mechanics. Beyond this, O'Murchu constantly invokes ""energy fields"" and ""forces"" all of which are undocumented in science but factor heavily in New Age type beliefs. In short, O'Murchu has no idea what he is talking about, and his writing makes for a nonsensical book that is filled with non-sequiturs and poorly explained reasoning."
1,Not as advertised.,"The book was advertised as brand new, but it had pencil markings and words written in the margin in one of the chapters. Very disappointed. Also took a long time to receive. Didn't want to send it back because I'd waited so long and had to return library copy, transfer paragraph tags, etc."
1,Good Table of Contents - Poor Book,This book is based on very healthy premises I think and the Table of Contents looks great ! What the author does with it though is very confusing. I have not found one chapter that was fully developped or even well understood. Even the chapter on mystics is I think quite poor and/or assumes you know everything about the subject. I think the book too ambitious and the author not clearly knowing where he wanted to take the reader. Very disappointing if you already have some insight on the subjects tackled.
1,Oxymoron,"This book is not a typical ABC book. For example, M is for multiple, O is for opportunity, and X is for excitement. Most of the words represent concepts and not enough action words and nouns. The age range is 2-8 years old but an 8 year old would not be interested in an ABC book with no plot. On the other hand, a two year old would be hard pressed to understand the content. Whatever happened to monkey, owl and xylophone?"
1,Variable volume,"The music is good, but orchestra is predominantly featured. It is much louder than the guitar segments. Listening to this CD in the car was difficult since 'road noise' drowned out the guitar sound. If you want predominantly guitar, pick something else!"
1,Doesn't even deserve one star.,"I make it a point not to read reviews or plot lines before reading books. I want to be surprised. Boy was I surprised. This started out as the typical Danielle Steele book (she tends to get in a rut, but sometimes the old standbys are comforting) but then it went so far askew. The only reason I finished the book was that I was hoping she'd somehow turned it around (like Bobby's dream in Dallas) and redeem herself. No such luck. It's not worth the time."
1,"This is not the band, Luna, that was formed by Dean Wareham.","This is not the NYC band, Luna, that was formed by Dean Wareham. It is a Spanish band (or a band singing in Spanish). I don't have an opinion about the music, I just gave it one star for miscategorization."
1,Not Barbara Bush's memoirs,"This is not the book you think you're buying. I thought I was buying ""Barbara Bush: A Memoir"" by Barbara Bush, which has the exact same cover. But this one is a biography in the third person by someone named Pamela Kilian. Unfortunately I figured this out only after I had paid for the book. This is a real bait and switch. Don't fall for it like I did!"
1,Nothing New,I read this book and I was just left wondering where the new material was. This book just goes over some general things that everyone knows. We need something a little meatier. Barbara can really be a great leader when she wants to. I just wish she didn't leave these books up to other people such as biographers and ghost writers.
1,Savvy investor?????,It is exactly what you would expect from a magazine. The information provided was basic investing 101 style material. It is more akin to the type of information you would get in a pamphlet rather than a true academic work. If you watch CNBC for 20 minutes per day you will be better informed than you will after reading this book.
1,Hard Live,"This album was very hard rocking, no doubt about it but I wish it had contained more Derringer band material rather than old Rick tunes like Still Alive And Well and Teenage Love Affair.Also I never quite got the appeal of Beyond The Universe which always sounded like a hodge podge of noise.If you wanna hear how arena rock sounded in the 70's then this is a good place to start but otherwise not one of Rick's best efforts."
1,Game Of Crap,"Lame ""Bruceploitation"" flick that actually succeeds in giving other Bruce Lee knock-offs a bad name. The lead character, adopting Bruce Lee's Chinese moniker, Hsio Lung and looking nothing like him, is asked by ""criminal elements"" (although the lack of anything resembling acting in this flick is the true crime) to star in their movie. Upon refusing, his Caucasian wife is threatened into poisoning him. He is somehow resurrected and goes on to pummel the bad guys in an atrocious rip-off of Game Of Death's pagoda fight. The only scene worth a look is Hsiao Lung ""getting it on"" with Alice. Look closely and see the White Alice mysteriously morph into an Asian body double for the nude scenes:-)Text-book case of El-Cheapo film-making at it's worst."
1,Don't waste your money-------totally stupid,There are no redeeming qualities in this book-----and there is absolutely no romance.
1,One of the worst books I have ever read,"I really disliked this book. Not only was it completely improbable, it was very repetetive. Ms. Steel should stay away from sci-fi subjects and stick to romance in a ""normal"" world. I cannot imagine why it was even published, except for the fact that Danielle Steel is a popular author."
1,I would not give this book any stars,It was one of her worst books I ever read. I like when she has a little mystery to her books.
1,"Too bad there are not ""0"" stars to award.",I have always been a Danielle Steele fan and have read most of her books.... until this one. It's hard to believe she really did the writing - so inferior and CHILDISH. I won't buy any more of her books.
1,Umbelievable,"I have enjoyed everyone of Danielle Steel's books. Her stories always take me far away from my own world. I have to say that this book was not what I expected. I like a story that I can see actually happening. This one was pretty far fetched. I still enjoyed the book, but prefered her first novels."
1,Joke's on us!,"I would have rated this less than one star if that had been available. Outside of the first couple of chapters which were, indeed, very witty, this book is a complete farce. Steel is obviously out of ideas and borrowed this from some bizarre sci-fi publication - or she is now trying to compete with current authors who have surpassed her in originality and research in their subjects. It's only saving grace is that it was just 245 pages. My rule that if I start a book I should finish it kept me from throwing this in the trash - which is where it now rests.If this book was meant as a joke -- then the joke's on us - for contributing money to Ms. Steel and receiving nothing in return. Booooo, hisssss!!!!"
1,Nothing New,"Having read many articles and several books, there was nothing new in this book for the general reader. Lacked substance also."
1,Mas o menos,"I really thought this book was going to go somewhere and as I got closer to the end, I was waiting for a great climax to the story. I was definitely disappointed in the end. Everything just kind of peters out and falls flat. I won't sum up the story .. that has been done before. However, I will say that I thought the book had some promise but after closing the cover I realized it was just an exercise in futility for me. All in all ... kinda blah."
1,greatly disappointed,"I looked forward to reading The Klone and I, because I had so enjoyed Steels's previous novels. Part of the enticement to continue reading a book, however, is an identification with the characters. In this case, there wasn't any. There was none forthcoming. Instead, I kept on wishing they would use their native intelligence, rather than pure emotion (or in Steel's world, the scent or essence of emotion). I actually kept on reading just to see if they would come to their senses!! I was keenly disappointed, and in the end, their fates did not concern me. That is the ultimate failure of the novel."
1,I thought it was going to be a romantic love story.,I was rather depressed after reading this story. I can't believe that DS wrote this book. I kept hoping that stupid female would wake up and go back to her first love. I thoughtthe book might get better at the end but it didn't. I wish I had never read it.
1,Unusual and Clumpy Story,I found this to be a little too far fetched and a little hard to believe. They way she normally writes you can see the whole setting and picture the characters easily. This was harder to imagine.
1,"Not Fulfilling, Not the Usual, Not one of the better books","I liked how this book was in a shorter format than her usual long novels. This is not one of my favorites, but I did enjoy it a bit. I didn't care for the clone plot and the romance was stale.I love the historicals like ""The Ghost"", and that leads me to continue cheering her on and buying her books.This story, was too unbelievable to be even fun. It was drawn out and boring. The beginning was good, it kept my interest, I wanted to see what would happen next... then the Klone entered the picture and it went down hill from there. The next few chapters basically just replay themselves.I don't recommend this one, but she hasn't lost a fan (yet)."
1,What a waste of paper!,"I have never felt disappointed about a Danielle Steel book, however, this book was the dumbest piece of fiction I have ever tried to read, I gave up after 40 pages or so. Ms. Steel shouldn't of wasted her time and ours by writing this. I will be leary about buying her next book."
1,The worst.,"I too, am an avid Danielle Steel fan. If she's trying to write comedy, she failed. Stick to the books your fans have loved for years, Danielle!"
1,Good bathroom material,"Accept this book for what it is! Just a piece of sci-fi fluff that was probably not meant to be anything but entertaining. This is NOT a book for the romantic reader. It is very farfetched and unrealistic, but I still found a few laughs here and there. Pick it up at a garage sale instead!"
1,The worse book she has written--completely stupid.,I have read all her books and this one is so rediculous I didn't even want to finish it. Where in the world did she come up with this idea. I was disappointed that she would spend time on a book like this instead of the outstanding ones she usually does.
1,well beneath Steele's standards,"Like others, I am a huge fan and buy her books as soon as they come out. I am sorry to have spent my money on this one. The only good it will be is as part of my collection. I would not recommend it or lend it out. I guess Ms. Steele finds it hard to come up with new ideas, but it wasn't necessary to go to such extremes. I will continue to read your books because I know how talented you are, please don't try your hand at sci-fi again, leave that to Stephen King."
1,Don't waste your money on this book,This book was so bad that I couldn't get past the first 30 pages or so. I wish I could get my money back. The whole plot was so absolutely ridiculous that I found myself shaking my head in disbelief as I read page after moronic page. Who is Danielle Steel trying to kid? Her readers deserve MUCH better than this. It is my personal opinion that her books have gotten progressively worse. The last 3 novels have been extremely shallow and uninteresting. The Klone And I is proof that she should stop cranking out the novels at the rate of 2 or 3 a year. She should be embarassed to have even had this book published!!! I hope that Danielle reads all of these reviews and saves herself the embarassment of another such disaster.
1,The absolute worst steele has ever written,"I have read all d. steele's books and for the most part have enjoyed her earlier books. They were easy and enjoyable reads. What in the world has happened....her last few books have been awful. After reading her last books, I have sworn that I will never read another one again. I wish I had listened to myself and not bothered to read the Klone & I. I did not find it ""wickedly funny"" and the book was full of much unnecesarry repetative narrative...if she mentioned the triple flips one more time...... While her books are always ""easy reads""--lately she seems to be writing at a level directed to readers whom she must feel have a low IQ. C'mon, Danielle, give us little more credit. If you must read this...please don't waste your money..borrow it from a friend or the library."
1,Who wrote this anyway,"I have read every Steel book at least once and own most of them in hardback. I was surprised that I was able to get this from the library. Now I know why. No one else wanted to read it. It was the worse one she has written. She should stick to history and away from the future. Zoya was one of the best. Ghost was different, but still very enjoyable. Try again, Danielle"
1,A Waste of Time and Money,"I have read all of Steele's books, and this is by far, without doubt, the worst book I have ever read bar none.As I read the book I felt that she was making fun of her readers (i.e. I can write pure junk and they will still buy it). I absolutely hated the constant references to brand names. I bet she used the words ""Dr. Pepper"" one hundred times in the first three chapters and in later chapters she refers to the ""quadruple flip"" over and over again. How stupid does she think we are?Lastly, the whole klone idea was just ridiculous. There was not one believable idea in this whole book. She has one more chance before I count myself out of her fan base."
1,"Too Amateurish, Seemed like an Erotica",This is not the average trash Danielle writes. It was too high-tech for me. I can't believe that she could write something like this. I feel that it was a poor one of her
1,This book is very vague.,"This book skips all the important details, it is fine for someone who is NOT going to Small Claims Court. This book is useless to the person who IS being sued."
1,The Klone and I,"A real disappointment by Danielle Steele. Not anything like any of her other books (and I have read them all) The storyline was so totally ridiculous and far fetched I even got tired of the humor that I assume was the point. No substance, no message. no heart."
1,Not DS at her best.,"I love Danielle Steel's work but this was not my type of enjoyable reading. Funny in the beginning I could not get a grasp of the concept that anyone could make a person so perfect as to make you believe they were real i.e. skin, hair, eyes, brain. heart. I guess that was my bottom line. It was not believable.It was definitely a step out of the ordinary for DS."
1,fast reading for an obvious reason,"Danielle Steel is a funny writer, as far as I know after reading ""The Klone and I: A high-tech Love Story."" She's funny because she thinks readers are dumb and gullible enough to buy her too-simple-to-describe plot... First of all, there is few description about cloning technology... I don't think so... Just imagine a clone arrives at the door of an ordinary house in suburban America. The female character should have called CNN first and the world should know about what's happening to the human race facing the dreadful consequences of irresponsible cloning scientists. It's very funny in the quirkiest way I've ever read."
1,Worst book I have ever read. Ever.,"This book was awful. An effort to combine science fiction and romance. I also do not believe Danielle Steele wrote this. I have to wonder, does someone else write her books? This cannot compare to her earlier novels, some of which were very good. I was very disappointed. It was extremely far-fetched, silly and unbelievable, and could not even qualify as decent science fiction."
1,The Klone and I,"Being a Danielle Steel fan, I was disappointed. This book is definitely not worth the read. I felt like I was reading something from The Twilight Zone. However, I will continue to purchase her books. Let's hope she doesn't have writer's block."
1,The worst Danielle Steele book!,"I have read almost all of her novels and loved all of them but this novel was terrible.Where in the world did she come up with this story? She must be running out of stories, if she has to write about a woman who falls in love with a man and his klone. I was so disappointed with this book."
1,A very disappointing read.,I have read many books by this author and I am very disappointed in this last one. The plot was stupid and the characters were stupid. If you must read this book then borrow it so you will have the money for a good book later.
1,The Empress is not wearing any clothes!,How did Danielle Steele get to be such a popular author? Her writing sucks!! Her prose is burdensome; the plot idiotic (doesn't the heroine feel any guilt or ickiness whatsoever about having sex with a cyborg?) and unrealistic (they have sex all night and all day long for 3 weeks straight?).
1,very bad writing,"The WORST book I have every read by anyone including Danielle Steele. Very disappointing. I only read it because my Mom wanted me to, so we could laugh at it together. Talk about sad."
1,I was very disappointed with the story content.,Danielle Steele is sliding downhill fast in this new book. The moral content of the story focuses on the differences in having sex with a klone and his inventor. It's not even believable. Clean up your act Ms Steele!
1,Pathetic waste of paper,"What was Danielle Steel thinking (or smoking) when she wrote this book? Her books are usually quite good, but this one is far from it. The concept of a ""klone"" in a romance novel is intriguing --- What possibilities it could have! (Too bad Ms. Steel couldn't think of any.) The writing was poor and the attempts at comedy lame beyond belief. Thank goodness I rented the book from the library and didn't waste my money."
1,needs to work on the beats and lirics,they need to get some better lirics like CHEZINA (el mejor) and some beats like THE NOISE or PLAYERO
1,A different Steel,"I have almost all of Danielle's books and I have read everyone, this story is much more different than the previous books she has written. I can't wait for the next book to come out. The Klone and the real man were both disgusting to read, how could the female have been such a fool?"
1,This book is trash.,"If this book was the first one that I had read of Danielle Steeles', I would probably not have ever read another one. Did she write this one herself?"
1,The worst of the worst for Danielle Steel,"This has been her worst book yet. I would not recommend this book to anyone. I am definitely a Danielle Steel fan, however, this time she dropped the ball. I'm sorry I paid for this book."
1,Weak attempt,"This novel started out well, but halfway through degenerated into cheap romance, cliched writing, and a plotline straight out of a soap opera. I found myself unable to care about any of the characters or what happened to them. Steel insisted on telling us, rather than showing, the important details, a device which greatly weakens any writing."
1,"Average, nothing new or spicy","I love Danielle Steel's novels, I've read them all and usually before they come out in paperback. My experience is to read them cover to cover in just a few days because they grab me and suck me into the story. This story, was too unbelievable to be even fun. It was drawn out and boring. The beginning was good, it kept my interest, I wanted to see what would happen next... then the Klone entered the picture and it went down hill from there. The next few chapters basically just replay themselves.I don't recommend this one, but she hasn't lost a fan (yet)."
1,You can't blame her for trying something new,"But going with the flow and the media (Dolly the sheep) just doesn't go ahead and create a good story. This book was revulting, falling in love with a man and a robot, yuck!I think all Danielle Steel fans should buy and read this book, not because it was good, but to see what bad writing is like, this is a great example. And for some reason (the name brand) this book is selling quite well. Well, that's Danielle Steel for ya, one powerful woman."
1,"Pathetic, Pitiful, Slender Little Book","Tedious I managed to get through the first 150 pages and decided I could not bear to go on. I did not care what happened to the weak woman or anyone else. I have placed this book in a box labeled ""In Case I Ever Go To Prison"" or get stranded on a barren island. Then I will be able and more than willing to finish this and other tedious books I have tried to get through."
1,"Oh Please, where's the plot?","As a dutiful Danielle Steel reader and avid fan, this book was dissapointing. I really wanted to enjoy this book as much as her others, I really did, but no matter how hard I tried to lie to myself, it didn't work.Please, no more experiments with these odd ball books, go back to the ones you are best at, romance, true romance."
1,The cover was the most interesting thing.....,I wish the book took on a more believable track. Ms. Steele has attempted to bring a sci-fi flavor to her book but instead resulted in a stale piece. I am glad the book was short or I would have quit half way thru...
1,Spare Me this Hideous Story,Someone spare me! There isn't much to say about this book by my beloved Danielle Steel because I wouldn't even consider it a book. It's worse than those that she wrote for teenagers!
1,Stay Away From this book! Back. Back. Back.,"An intriguing science fiction that turned deadly, don't even try. It's too simple minded for the science fiction savy, too unusual for the typical romance reader.Unless you're a die-hard Steel fan, don't even bother."
1,Truly disappointing,"As a proud owner of every Danielle Steel novel ever written, I had read the poor reviews of ""The Klone and I"" but decided to give it a chance and ordered it nonetheless. I should have taken the advice of many readers and critics, and saved myself the expense and effort of having this book shipped across many thousand miles to me. How disappointing! I am only grateful that it was a fast read. The plot is so utterly ludicrous that it fails to be even the least bit entertaining, much less stimulating. Even the most dedicated, devoted, die-hard DS fans like myself would be much better off sitting this one out."
1,Stale Tale,"Where's the romance? All this book was about was a woman and her man and the klone. Uh huh...and? There was no plot at all, just a story that drifted, and ended as it should have, short."
1,A disaster from page 1,"From page one this book was definately going to be nothing, that's what I though, that's what I found.Danielle Steel, go back to your fortes."
1,On Drugs,I give this book one star as there was nothing lower to choose from. Save your money. This book is not worth either your time or your money. Was she on drugs during the writing of this piece of tripe?
1,Steel has sold out on her public,"The book is uneven, written on an elementary school level, has terrible character development, and is utterly predictable, particularly if you've read his books before. Even the protagonist, who potentially can be the most complex character Steel has ever created, is passed off to us as one-dimensional."
1,A Big Waste of Time and Money,"Quite possibly the worst book I've ever read. Even though I kept waiting for it to get better, it never did. Don't bother with this one."
1,Not Up to Par,"She's an excellent author and can do better than this one.Just finished a book club meeting a while ago, we agreed on giving what Steel deserves with this book: bad customer reviews."
1,Don't Waste your money on this trash,"Tired plot, the cast was not memorable. I was sorely disappointed.reader, Sally"
1,I Stopped Reading this Halfway Through,I stopped reading this halfway through when I figured out nothing was happening either plotwise or characterwise. The previous book by Danielle Steel was disappointing as well. It just ended very abruptly. I'm not sure what's going on here -- too much time spending research?
1,1 star- that's what it deserves,"Sorry Danielle, this was the third strike. I will give any author two bad books, but not three. This was so bad I didn't even finish it."
1,Where is the suspense...?,This book is a fall from the standard we expect from this author. Where is the suspense and who thought up this wacky computer scheme?
1,Don't Read the Book,"I fully understand the need for an author to ""break out"" periodically and follow a new avenue -- but this ""avenue"" is full of pot holes, leaving this reader to wonder who really wrote this book and why it was published. Books like this can make a reader distrust a favorite writer's future work."
1,VERY BAD...A REAL LET DOWN!,"I continued reading, hoping it would get better... it didn't! Too many characters, very confusing sentences...they didn't make any sense. The characters are boring. I'm sorry I wasted my weekend reading this book."
1,Do we have reason to follow this story-line?,"Only with ample reason should anyone read this recent release, this will be a complete waste. I'm wandering if this story-line is going somewhere."
1,Not worth Anything,"As an avid fan of all her books, THE KLONE AND I was a huge disappointment. It seemed like it was written by someone else. Characters were poorly developed, the story line was disjointed, and the story provided no sense of closure. It is an insult to her talent and her readers' loyalty.from: Janet L."
1,A preview to the future????,"When I finished reading this book, I sat for awhile thinking about the way technology has advanced thus far--and laughed when I tried to picture a woman actually living this story. It was funny and relaxing at the end of a long day. I recommend it to all those who enjoy Steel's book. It's refreshing and what I affectionatey call my 'no-brainers'."
1,Worst book I have ever read,I have read all 50 books and cannot believe the same person wrote this book.
1,Fst Fwrd to the last 8 min please.,"Hello World,I'm really starting to give up on anything new in horror. But who cares about me? Well, just a warning for wary wayside folk who havn't viewed this little piece of Uli Lomelish garbage! Wow everybody lets shoot sodium penethal(sp) and sit around in a circle contemplating what to do with this guy we tied up. To bad some a%$ kicker didnt find their invitation. Extremely unlikable characters kinda original story and about 2.5 mins. total of the ""murdering"". What a waste of my life. I coulda been cleaning pubic hair out of my shower drain. Good luck"
1,Rancid Turd,"This film is advertised as 'terrifying and funny' but fails to do either. The movie creeps along at a snail's pace, with haphazard, obviously impromptu dialogue. Additionally, there are none of the redeeming B-movie qualities present: no nudity, no great special effects, and no worthwhile villian. At the end of this very boring movie, I was glad most of the principle characters were dead, thus alleviating any serious worries that a sequel could be on its way. The awfulness of this film will linger like a ripe fart."
1,2.5 for effort but ungrounded and poorly paced,"Take the decent premise of a black invitation to a MURDER PARTY blowing down the street and someone picking it up and alot of ideas come to mind.I kind of expected what follows but to its credit the movie isn't entirely predictable or tiresome. The drug addled exploits and dialogue of the main characters are mildly entertaining if not overtly self aware and hyper hip low budget versions of your average Bret Easton Ellis college kids trying to mimic Man Rey and the idea of ""murder as art""It feels like a decent staged student film in the end however despite a crank eating canine, several effective old school eighties F/X injuries and an unlikely death by pumpkinbread. I didn't feel like I completely wasted my time with this one and it has an okay HALLOWEEN (the holiday vibe) it just isn't compelling, believable or funny enough to recommend it to anyone or to watch it over again."
1,coaching youth baseball,"The author does not know the actual fundamentals of baseball, incorrect hitting an bunting techniques. concentrates on the politics of youth baseball and not drills and skills."
1,it was not worth the money,"With all of that discount, I thought it would be a good deal; but the high shipping cost compensated for the seemingly low price!"
1,"East of Good Music, West of Enjoyable","This was a poor effort by a-ha. You can tell by its sales ranking: The Rockwell Box Set did better. The only thing that makes this CD look good is by compairing it to their new CD, Analogue, which should be sold with an apology to all a-ha fans. A-ha got lazy, and greedy on this one. A-ha got back on track with Lifelines and most certainly, Minor Earth/Major Sky. But East of the Sun, West of the Moon, no good."
1,I can't believe the 5 stars on this album,"This album is terrible and a far cry from ""Hunting High and Low"" and ""Scoundrel Days"". This album was the nail to a-ha's coffin. They lost the magic out of this one and dont be surprised if US did not give it any airplay for a lot of the songs are not listenable. I brought this one for I had their first 3 CDs and was hoping something good out of it. 5 stars? Give me a break. Before you buy this album be sure you like their first 3."
1,Shipping Stinks,"Shipping was crummy; I actually HATE those services that pick up the package and a few days later turn it over to the USPS for delivery... it's not faster, in fact, I think it's several days slower and you can't track the shipment. Actually you can track: it goes - package input to system, package picked up, package given to USPS for delivery - then all info goes dark for a few days. Sellers; put a stinkin' stamp on the box and ship it yourself, it will get there faster. This was a replacement and I noticed that even though the model number is the same they have downgraded the volume of air it puts out - not the seller's problem (but the shipping method is)."
1,Sinus Relief,"Some minor relief after 3-4 days of taking 2 tablets , 3 times per day.I would not recommend this product. Even though it is much more expensive, Clariton D is more effective."
1,Don't even bother,I purchased this because of the good reviews. I suffer from allergies and I have a congested nose most of the time.I just tossed the few tablets left in the trash.
1,Really bad choice!!!!!!,I have been a PSB fan for years.....this album is horrible. Sorry I bought it.//Patrick
1,DO NOT BUY THIS,"This is an utterly aweful release that features an Italian lead singer attempting to cover Pet Shop Boys' tunes. It should be listed as a comedy album. An example of how ""Suburbia"" is murdered:""Let take ride, runs with de dog tonight...""It really is laughable. I spent $7.99 on it, and I feel violated and dirty for even having it on my shelf. Trust me, even if you're a PSB completist (as I am), your collection doesn't need to be THIS complete."
1,Awful Dryer,"This is a very cheap, flimsy dryer. Don't waste your money, the thing will be non functional, or on it's last legs within a couple of months."
1,Crap!,"I love PSB, however, this is not even them! It's sounds like A Name That Tune or Star Search person! I'm very disappointed with this CD and feel that it doesn't even belong on the PSB list of CD's. A waste of cash!"
1,Horrible!!,"This is NOT the Pet Shop Boys. Recordings this poor rarely make it out of bootleg street markets in Hong Kong. Clearly for the people who recorded this, English is not their primary tongue. Avoid this CD like the plague!"
1,DId not receive the item I ordered,I ordered the unit displayed on the web site and received a totally different product. I ordered a continuous current fence control device and received a device which fluctuates the current. My dog figured out he can jump the fence when the current is off for a second. I called and explained what I needed and was told that the inventory department was closed but someone would contact me the next Monday. No one contacted me and later on that week UPS showed up at my house to pick up the product. I was not home at the time. I am not overly impressed with the service of this company. I am not impressed at all.
1,AMAZON.COM PLEASE!,"Why do you (amazon.com) insist on putting these poor imitations with the artists? If you do, at least you could do is say ""NOT THE ORIGINAL ARTISTS"" you are doing your customers a disservice by letting them think that they are getting a ""MEGAMIX"" of their favorite artist--such as the ones we hear at the dance clubs. PLEASE, do your customers a favor and refrain from putting these TRASHY cd's with the original artist and put them where they belong--FAKE ARTISTS! BY THE WAY--HOW ABOUT A ""NO STAR"" rating--this CD doesn't even deserve ""1 STAR""!"
1,The Answer is NO,"For the Mountain completist only. I spun this a few times and it's been buried ever since the year of it's release.Comparing this to Nantucket Sleighride is akin to comparing a later day Paul McCartney release to Sgt. Peppers. Leslie is a great guitar player. His songwriting is spotty. There are better Leslie West releases in the past 20 years.In terms of Mountain, get Nantucket Sleighride, Climbing!, The Road... or Flowers of Evil before this. Some of the ""bootleg"" releases sold here (the twin Fillmore East concert from 71, San Bernadino 71, Capitol Theatre 74) are exceptional. That's the Mountain you want to listen to."
1,"liked the convience, not the quality",3 out of 4 books were hopefully ok but the copy i kept to re-read broke apart when i turned the pages. i hope the ones i sent for gifts were better than the copy i kept...will see what the recipients say and repost if their experience was like mine.
1,Disappointed,"Don't waste your time reading the entire book. The book makes some good points, but as in other Spencer Johnson works, they are sparse with filler in between. Fortunately, the author was kind enough to place several summary pages throughout the book.Save time and money:1. Get the book from the library or a friend.2. Read pages 55, 74 and 100."
1,Video Quality Terrible,This tape looks like a home made copy of the commercial Let It Be VHS complete with home made label on the tape. The video and audio quality of this thing is horrible.RIP OFF! Don't waste your money!
1,Street Fighter- the Motion Picture album,"My big brother loves just one track- as we are UK residents, I have to say that we got SOMETHING THERE in our album (The track my brothers hooked on.). The rest are pretty dire.I love the film, got it on video and it's great. I wish I could say that about the music though...."
1,A Disappointment,I really enjoyed the movie and looked forward to getting the soundtrack. None of the vocals were on the CD. The only tracks were of the instrumental background music and several were repeated a couple of times but under different names. What a waste of $14.00.
1,Automatically shuts off before I'm finished drying!,"This dryer has the irritating feature of automatically shutting off long before I'm finished using it; it can only then be turned back on a few minutes later. Perhaps it's an inherent safety feature to prevent it from overheating, but even if so shouldn't it be designed to not overheat until it goes well past normal usage?Don't waste your money."
1,not what i expected,This CD for me was a waste of money. Its just not what i thought it would be. Others may enjoy it but for me..it wasnt what i was hoping to hear.
1,"SOME ONE SHOULD REVIEW ITEMS ""FIRST""","THIS IS A TWO DISC CD. DISC #1 IS CODED AS #1. DISC #2 IS CODED AS #1 ALSO. I CAN PLAY EACH DISC BY ITS SELIF. BUT YOU CAN NOT LOAD THEM ON YOUR COMPUTER AS DISC ONE AND TWO. I LOAD DISC #2 THEN TRIED TOO LOAD DISC #1 BUT ONLY GOT THE 19th SONG. THEN I TRIED THIS LOADED DISC #2 EDITED IT AS DISC #2 THEN LOADED DISC #1 LOADING WENT AS IF EVERTHING WAS FINE. BUT WHAT I GOT WAS AN INDICATION OF DISC #1 AND #2 IN THE LIBARAY. BUT ALL I GOT WAS SONG #19 FROM DISC #2. WHERE DOES THE ""PRIDE"" IN THE PRODUCT COME FROM? I HAVE A CD I CAN NOT PUT ON MY COMPUTER. WHAT CAN YOU DO FOR ME? I THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. LEVI RALPH KOHR."
1,Terrible,There was nothing scary about this film. The storyline was boring and really didn't match in with the story too well.
1,ALMOST SCARES YOU,Ghost Story wants to scare you but it just misses right to the end. Krige is excellant I must admit as the ghost. The story line is very good and the book must have been very good but the way the script was put together for the movie was awful. The movie never really scares you except for the scene at the end when Krige (The Ghost) goes down in the shivery water trapped in a car. An average horror movie at best.
1,"Ah, that classic meeting of old Shanghai and... Brooklyn","So, take 1 part Chinese instrumental music from the 1920s-1950s, add some ""Beats"" and digital editing... okay, I'm with you so far... and then have black women sing over it in English, all R&B; diva like, u kno wat I'm sayin', mmm-hmm... uh, what?I understand the remixing and mash-ups projects of late. Some of the Verve Remixed stuff was good. The Shanghai Divas Remixed project tried to put the same concept to Chinese classics of the 1940s and '50s, but with pretty mediocre results. The execution was rather amateur.But this is just an atrocity. It doesn't go together at all. Yes, you can put tomatoes, strawberry ice cream, and curry in the blender and come up with a smooth new concoction... but that doesn't mean it'll taste good. This is atrocious and I find it totally condescending to the source material."
1,Product not worth buying,Purchased this product and thought it would work perfectly in keeping my dogs from the garden. After hooking it up if worked for a month or so and then stopped working (go figure) just after the return date had expired at Amazon. Stay away from this product. The shock is good but the product stops working in a short period.
1,...,"I love the song ""Over the Line"" which has been playing on the radio, so I took a chance and bought this CD...bad idea. OTL is the only good song on it. The rest are just too gimmicky to even listen to. I know, I know...what can we expect from LA boys trying to sing country. Die hard Bellamy Bro fans might like this CD, but that's about it."
1,Not informative.,The video is supposed to be about the beautiful city of Assisi. Instead it is about people's opinions of Assisi. Very little footage of the scenery that Assisi is famous for.
1,The Bureaucrat of Monticello,"In this book Noble Cunningham has managed to make one of the most fascinating figures in American history pedestrian. He provides a dutiful recounting of the facts of Jefferson's life, but never makes him come alive. His thesis--that Jefferson saw the use of reason as the highest human undertaking--is certainly valid, but Jefferson was a man of enormous contradictions, none of which are truly explored here. This book makes the man who said ""Democracy ought to be periodically washed in blood"" seem like a hardworking civil servant."
1,A disgusting and horrifying read.,"""The Gay Agenda"" is more or less a book made by zealous idiots, for zealous idiots. It is interesting, and something the gay community should look into. But the fact that people are actually believing the propaganda in this book, is sickening."
1,New Hate Object,"Now the religious right has a new punching bag. It used to be Jews, or women (witches). Jews, no matter how poor and downtrodden they seemed, were actually bent on world domination. Women - your wife, mother, daughter - were possessed of secret powers straight from the devil. Now it's the gays' turn. They are rich, powerful, subversive, out to torpedo all morality and goodness in this world. But maybe the people who are out to control the world are the exact same people who have been controling it for centuries - religious extremists."
1,Don't be mislead,"Although, there are some good things to learn from this book, I got rather bored with the hammering home of the power of positive thinking. Also, I was under the impression from the friend who recommended the book that the book contained Christian values. It does, but it also contains ""spiritual"" values that are not mainstream Christian teaching, such as accepting homosexuality, reincarnation, and others. I just think it fair to warn someone looking for fundamental Christian literature, that this is definitely not what they are looking for."
1,A must read for all ages!,Everyone should read this book. It is the most inspiring thing ever written. Ms. Shin explains how to get the things you want in life with positive thinking and behaviors. Think it...and it will happen. Ms. Shin believes that good things happen to those who believe in the power of positive thinking. She teaches that fear is the great crippler. Fear is the roadblock to all things good. It is timeless advice for anyone looking for ways to improve their lives.
1,bigots,"I whole heartedly disagree with what this book has to say. There is no ""gay agenda"" except to earn equal rights for everyone, regardless of their race, gender, class, origins, or sexual orientation. If you read the history of the civil rights movement you will see many similar accusations against that movement, as well as womens sufferage. This book is full of religious hatred, and disinformation. This author does not even attempt to see the other side of this argument. All they seem to do is point fingers, and slander our friends, kids, uncles, aunts, grandchildren, brothers, sisters, and other loved ones who are gay, lesbian, bisexual, or transgendered. Read this book only if you would burn a cross on a black mans front lawn. Thats the kind of hatred that is being spread here."
1,who is afraid of the big bad homos?,"Now who do you think would be afraid of the big bad homos trying to take over the world? My first guess would be people insecure about their own sexuality.Its okay to be gay. You don't need to be afraid. If exposure to and tolerance of homosexuals threatens you, you might want to examine your motives instead of the motives of your so called enemies. I think the problem lies within the authors, not the community he tries to condemn."
1,A Picture of the Religious Right Agenda,"This book is the typical diatribe which would deny civil rights to several million, in a country whose constitution provides for religious freedom and which, from the Declaration of Independence on, seeks (or supposedly seeks) to provide equal rights for all. While attempting to impose their own religious and value system on the nation as a whole, the authors continue to press their beliefs and values on everyone else. It is sad that they would deny civil (not religious, civil) rights to any group because they do not fit their viewpoint.At this time, if the religious right wishes to call homosexuality a choice (which it is not), and deny civil rights protections for that ""choice"", ethically they must also work vigorously to remove civil rights protections based upon marital status--also a ""choice""!"
1,Very sad that anyone would believe such paranoid tripe...,"Move along, thinking folks, nothing to see here.More deluded paranoia and preaching to the misguided choir, strictly for the sort of people so gullible and brainwashed as to be able to believe the childishly absurd claims made herein.The audience for this alleged ""book"" consists of those with severely limited thought processes, and those who enjoy a laugh.It's bad enough that there are persons so fundamentally corrupt and deceitful as to argue that >> not being allowed to violate the rights of other citizens by cramming absurd superstitious beliefs down those others' throats << is a violation of THEIR rights - that's sad, indeed. But that there is anyone over the age of eight who is credulous enough to buy such laughable humbug, that constitutes a national tragedy!"
1,A dull trip down memory lane,"Ok for erotica the book does have numerous somewhat steamy scenes since our heroine, Lara, seems to be always on the verge of masturbating and/or asking for someone to put it in quick....Lara, after 20 years has decide to go to an art school, wherelse but in a remote hidewaway in the English countryside. She's looking to rekindle lust for an artist from her younger years.I guess if I suffered from attention deficit disorder I would have enjoyed this book because none of the erotic scenes seem to ever come to a logical conlusion, but rather, the reader is ripped away to another scene ......."
1,Don't even bother.,"Twenty years ago Lara was an art student dating one brother, but really lusting for the other brother. Now she returns to her old haunts where she knows she will met up with Jake, the brother she always wanted. There really isn't enough plot to keep this story going for 250+ pages. The sex scenes are not very hot, and the whole thing turns out to be dull and contrived. Lara is either drunk or on drugs through half the book. And, why is she sleeping with every Tom, Dick, & Harry.There are a lot of good Black Lace boos, but this isn't one of them."
1,People of Faith Need to Read this Book,"As someone affiliated with broadcasting, I found this book both compelling and frightening. This book allows us to see that communications, entertainment, and news have all been very heavily influenced by a force the authors refer to as ""The Homosexual Agenda."" There are plenty of books that dissect how people turn toward homosexual behavior, and there are books arguing all sides in the debate about homosexual behavior, but this might be the first book of its kind. This book actually looks at homosexuality from the point of view of Christianity, and the message is simple and provocative: love the sinner but don't embrace the sin, be compassionate but don't enable damaging behavior. People of faith everywhere need to read this book."
1,not very good indications,"Please research first, instructions are not clear at all, and once I got this, I figured out this is for SER versions only.."
1,Terrible...typical christian conversative muck,Hate and discrimination are family values in ultra-Christian households...
1,total waste of time,"This book was a total waste of time. Full of high-blown, flowery prose, lofty hypotheses, and absolute nonsense. Sometimes a Ph.D thesis--which this apparently was before the University of Chicago Press was convinced to publish it--ought to remain a Ph.D. thesis. A waste of trees, a waste of ink, and a waste of time. Save your money and read the yellow pages--you will enjoy it more than Masters of All They Surveyed"
1,Masters of All That They Surveyed,"An interesting, well researched book about Robert Schomburgk's attempts to obtain a place for himself in history within the context of setting forth British Guiana's borders using the science and land surveying techniques available to him in the 19th century. The prose of book, however, is what native Guyanese would call 'high falautin' and, toward the end, I disagree with a few of his political theories on modern Guyanese politics; moreover, significantly, there is some repetition. In the end, Graham adds a human and scientific aspect to the discourse concerning the disputed boundaries. The editors should have allowed for a rewrite and/or the author should not have rushed to market or allowed for more maturity. I would recommend the paperback."
1,Gay threat to freedom,"Given that one group's civil rights can generally only be attained at the expense of another's, I can only feel a certain affinity with the sentiments of this book. Like many people, I am continually affronted by those leading an openly gay lifestyle, and I feel this to be an infringement of my rights. I feel marginalised, like my own rights are in competition with other groups around me. Gay homosexuals have dominated the discourse for far too long, and it's good to see their previously unassailable position of power and social acceptance finally challenged, even if it is challenged from such an underfunded, underdog position as ""Christianity"". My right to be morose and melancholy has been openly mocked for too long by the unrelenting merriment around me. It's good to see someone fighting back. I can't bring myself to give this book more than 2 stars, however, because of the disturbing depiction of gaiety on the cover."
1,I can't believe this hateful book claims to be Christian!,"Christianity is about accepting Christ as your savior and about accepting and loving others.The only ""homosexual agenda"" is the desire to be treated as equals. The right to keep your job, the right to choose your domestic partner, and the right to be safe from violence are not special privileges. These are human rights that heterosexual people take for granted in their own lives."
1,My Worst Amazon Purchase - Ever,Although the book binding is good the contents are unreadable. The scanning process was unable to decode the text with the result that only a few words per page are legible. There was no quality control and they sent me garbage. Don't but it.
1,not their best,"some good songs but overall not worth buying, i recomend just down load the individual songs you like"
1,how to get lost in Rome,"This Rome Walking Guide included an eclectic mix of sites to visit, and the walks were comprehensive. However, it omitted precise directions to and from each attraction. Addresses for most sites were omitted, as were many street names. The included maps were not very detailed and ended up confusing us more than helping. We found ourselves frustrated and lost more times than not. The compact size of the guide made it easy to carry around, but it was lacking in historical background. A bit more information on the attractions would have enhanced the experience of each walk. Overall, the guide lacked clarity, detailed directions, instructions and background -- all crucial for a special experience. I would not recommend this guidebook for first time visitors to Rome."
1,This is not a come back.,"I have listened to Bone Thugs back in the days from their first album ""Faces of Death"". In comparison to their older albums (their first five albums) this album ""Stenght & Loyalty"" cannot compete. There is a lot of R&B incorporated which is not what most RAP/Hip-Hop listeners are looking for; R&B that is not top of the chart worthy (with the exception of ""Lil' Love). Bone Thugs don't need to drop the R&B, but they need to start making more RAP/Hip-Hop style melodies/beats. I am sorry to say, in exception to a few songs on this album this album is a disappointment just like their other albums after ""BTNH Resurrection""."
1,does not say sacd,no where on this cd does it state this is a sacd. with past reviews about amazon selling mistatted sacd items i am simply returning it unopened. Amazon you have got to start listing these better as i am starting to divert my sacd shopping elsewhere. just can't trust you any more:(
1,For simple minds,This tutorial is for people that are just learning multitrack recorders by boss.No instructions on how to loop or anything eles instructive to someone who may need help with advanced settings .Boring and not worth 10 dallors!!
1,bone thug n harmony suck please retire,"we don't wanna hear you praise the lord come on what's wrong with krazie, wish, and flesh and working with yolanda adams at that hell she ain't no saint this shows she wants a thug in her life if she's married her hubby better watch before she sleeps with these gangster rappers bone has gotten sorry over the years swizz beatz is the only one who had faith in these boys come on we wanna hear ouija boards, drugs, and death not so9ngs with freak azz mariah carey it's official I'm never listening to any new project by bone thugz n hatrmony I prefer all their classics."
1,"Novel: Excellent, Film: Not!","First, let me say that Straub's novel is one of the finest ghost stories ever written. It's terrifying, too, as good ghost stories should be. Hence, I had high expectations of this film. The fact is the film is dreadful! It's almost nothing like the novel, and the only reason I give it two stars is due to some atmosphere. The cinematography looks good. That's about it. Spend your money, sure, but spend it on the novel and you'll spend many dark evenings in your reading chamber casting furtive glances at those darkened corners."
1,STUPID!,"I can't believe I actually bought this book! I love Danielle Steel, but this book had to be a joke! I'll make sure I come here to check the reviews before I ever buy a book again!"
1,somewhat entertaining but poorly written,"Well, I just got back from a trip to Rome and read this book on the plane. Yes, at times it was funny --- as the other reviewers have noted. Yes, I learned some things about the Vatican I didn't know before. But the book is also disjointed, repetitive, poorly edited, and written in a style that was wordy, manipulative of the reader, and with barely veiled sexism in his repeated references to the physical appearance of the women he sees or meets. I had the impression the author was just trying to fill enough pages to make it book length. It was not a pager turner."
1,this game is bad,"in WOW you can level up get armor and stuff like that, but in this game you only get powerthingies and your gudged by your looks and power thingies. i would strongly recomend to play WoWinstead of CoV"
1,Disappointing,"I kept hoping this book would redeem itself. Line after line, page after page I was disappointed. The writing wasn't bad but the story itself simply did not work. It was as if the author tried to force every scene and character into some bizarre and glum mold. I enjoy many genres and have read tragic but compelling stories. The only tragedy about this one is that I wasted time reading it."
1,Depressing and inaccurate,"I grew up in Pueblo and was a teenager during the 1930's. I bought this book with the great expectation that wonderful memories from my growing up years would send me down nostalgia lane. There was abosolutely no similarity to the Pueblo I know and remember in the novel.With the exception of a few familiar names like Gast the characters were far different from the people I knew well. The Gast's were neighbors of mine. They were well respected in the community and beloved by all who knew them. Julavits depicts Pueblo as being in the dust bowl. In the 55 years that I lived there, I do not recall one single dust storm as she described. I guess if you are going to write fiction, you may as well make everything up.The story itself was difficult to follow because her style of dreamy surreality was boring. The plot was weak and the storyline odd and very depressing. Sorry Miss Julavits, your first attempt was a stinker."
1,A Misfire,"Stripped to its basics, this novel amounts to little more than a series of concocted images of the macabre--all, I assume, to build a menacing atmosphere in an otherwise common-place story of an unhappy marriage. The effect, sadly, is the opposite. Rather than shudder at each pointed reference to blood, pus, feces, scabs, roadkill,and prosthetic limbs, the sheer redundancy of these images became an irritating distraction and prompted me to abandon the book halfway. Where, I wondered, were the editor's red pens, good sense, and bottles of white-out?..."
1,"Yaddo, Yaddo, Yaddo","I almost used the title: How many gratuitous dead babies does it take to make a bestseller? Offensive? Yes. But not entirely inaccurate. This is not your ""feel good summer beach read.""This is the kind of book that comes out of writers' workshops. Overwrought and over-long with symbolism overwhelming story at every turn of page.Mineral Palace is bleak and tedious. Too many plot points end up being pointless. And how do such cardboard characters withstand such raging duststorms?As a work of fiction, I don't care whether this is an accurate depiction of Pueblo in the 30s. I do care that I was lured into this town with the promise of a good story and left with just a few stunning images (The Buffalo Mass Suicide)."
1,Not even worth 1 star,"This book is the biggest wast of time, money and paper I have ever seen. First off the title might well be called THE WICCAN VERSION OF VOODOO. This book is filled with nonesence. The author presents no bibliography but clearly takes many passages from Jambalaya by Luisah teish along with the very same drawuings she has in her book. Please Please Please dont waste your money on this awfull book."
1,worth it for the 'Vodou Pentacle' illustration,"Entertaining. Not accurate, but has nice illustrations. I purchased this for the 'Vodou Pentacle' ( Web ) pic. I have a friend with a tattoo of the 'Vodou Pentacle' and I respect the concept, as explained to me, by an Initiate.However, the book, itself.... well, it is mis-titled. This book is a slap-dash, thrown-together collection of ""stuff."" If you are looking for a book about ""Voodoo Rituals,"" this isn't what you are looking for. Yet, it is entertaining and has some useful tidbits about various (not voodoo or Vodou) magickal entities and whatnot. I would not recommend buying this book because of the title--which is misleading. Some of the stuff in this book, I would consider ""Hoodoo"" and, maybe ""Voodoo,"" but not ""Vodou.""I agree with the person who said this appears to be a ""Personal Journal."" I just do not understand why so many Magickal systems are lumped-together under the title of the book."
1,"end of game is slow, requires disc","you will need to have the disc to start this game. a bummer when you're on a laptop on the road and you just want to play a video game. most people don't carry around the cds that come with their software anymore. it also doesn't stop people from copying games illegally or cracking them to use without discs (do a google search).that said, the game play is good, the graphics are nice, but the end game gets to be pretty slow moving. i have a fairly recent macbook pro and this game gets really sluggish as there are more units and map revealed. kind of sad since that's when it gets more interesting.buy world of warcraft instead. this game is a poor port to the mac platform."
1,poor quality,The music is great it's too bad the volume is almost non existent. You have to turn it up very loud to be able to hear it at all.
1,Will not run and Amazon will not help,I received this program and loaded it into my Mac Book. The software gives an error message when starting up and cannot use. I tried to contact Amazon but they do not answer and make it very difficult to find them. I had no option but to begin a dispute through American Express.A waste of time and money.
1,"""the worst book ever written""",I had the complete misfortune to get an advanced copy of the horror story. I would have to say it is a completley one sided account of an insane person. The rambling poorley written stories read like a third rate tabloid. The author wants pity for herself without any compassion for her family. I could go on and on but I feel that I have already spent too much time on this horrible book and story. Do not ever read this book.......
1,"Pity for the reader not the ""characters""","Well its not often that a book grabs my attention as much as this one did. It is a tragic story for everyone who had to deal with the main character ""June"". The main character is so completley one sided in her development in the story. It would seem the author would like us to feel sorry for ""June"" but all her sad tales make us feel sorry anyone who has ever come in contact with this person. Its a story about hate, and a person who can not forgive."
1,Living with RSD,"never received book, was old it wasout of stock after a week for the much needed book."
1,The book is so foolish,"Gee wiz. I read this book on a flight from LA to NYC. What a joke my seat mates and I were laughing all the way. It was so poorley composed, and the character development did not exist. This is clearly a first time author, I think she got her ispiration from tabloids, and tv mini series. Good look Gavin you need it."
1,a terrible read.,"the story could be intriguing if the author had divulged more info. about the characters. there is poor character development which leads one to believe that the work is that of a novice with ties to the literary community. who published this? it is flat and one sided, not to mention the fact that the main character never seems to overcome any of the obstacles put in front of her. i hope that the work is fiction, if not, i hope she seeks treatment for her inability to cope with the world around her."
1,Pinch Me I Must be dreaming.,"Well this is the best and the worst book I ever read. I was at liberties in Boca Raton, and a woman with big hair, and tight skin came up to me in the parking lot. She gave me a copy of betrayed. She winked and hobbled away. It was the best because it was free. It was the worst for the way it was written. My biggest complaint was the character development. It was all to one sided. I guess the whole point is who cares who is this June. I wonder where she could be. Her family was right and all the possible mistakes they might have done were all her fault. June set the example for everyone. It is all here doing, she did it all to her self."
1,Why Oh Why do we have to suffer,This is the saddest book I ever did read. How could a person be tortured so much by her family. Betrayed does not even begin to explain how the main character was dealt with. The writing was so vivid it seemed as if I could smell the stench of June perfume. The character development was deep. June suffered so her family could succed. I only wish this was a true story so I could give June a big hug and tell he it is all going to be ok. I hope Ms Gavin never writes another book she will never be able to top this wonderful pamphlet book.
1,Oh Me oh MY,"Mrs Gavin is not a smart woman. She maybe be nice but she is not a true author. I wonder if she wrote this story on a boat? Its so dis jointed, and random. Get a clue this is pure fiction. It does not have any character development. Please let her get some help, maybe a stay at bellview."
1,Give Me a break Already,"This book is a joke. It should be filed under humor. It was actually funny in some parts. The main character cries for all her pain, and it is so obvious that its all self inflicted. The poor dear if she needed to get out of her bad realtionship, all she had to do was stop being a witch. I fell sick that I even read this book. Put it in the trash."
1,Beautiful tragic story,"WOW! This book knocked me out! I could not believe that this book was actully published. It is an outragious story. The main character June is such a tragic wispy little soul. Oh how I felt her pain, and rejoiced in her accomplishmnets. I am very happy to hear about the Mini Series on Fox. I am planing to see Ms. Gavin on her many stops as the tours the country with her wondefully horrible book. Good Luck on your next book Betrayed II back from the past."
1,"All Hat, No Cattle","Caveat emptor: I bought this book in order to scan the section on Vicksburg, so my comments only pertain to that portion of the book.After scanning the section on Vicksburg, I was not tempted in any way to read the rest of the book. She was consistently wrong on nearly every aspect of the Vicksburg Campaign ... from the placement of the fortifications at Chickasaw Bayou (they were NOT on top of the hills, Rowena) to Grant's grand plan of operations when he set foot on dry soil at Milliken's Bend (we see in the Papers of Ulysses S. Grant that he intended all along to move south of the city). Major gaps exist in the O.R. material for this period, and Rowena fills in these gaps with hateful vitriol. I'm not sure what her game is, but it is not history."
1,Good lord this is horrible,"Forget about nostalgia. Watching this concert will scar your memories. I loved these guys in their prime and attended several concerts. Hoping to relive some of the joy through this DVD.This video is just a notch above bootleg and I mean a notch. At least they held the camera steady. The visuals are horrible. Grainy, extremely blurry and just a horrendous to watch. The audio will make you cringe. The balance is non existent. Some instruments you can't even hear, others are too prominent. All this just ruins the experience of trying to enjoy the concert. I regret reading and trusting the 'good' reviews of this DVD. This is not even remotely enjoyable to watch or listen to.I laugh in a hurtful way when it says bonus material. Whatever... It's one more song and it's recorded worse than the previous songs. This is a horrible product. I cannot get rid of this DVD fast enough."
1,Outdated and Not Very Helpful,"I teach rolling lessons on a weekly basis and I purchased this book because I am always trying to find new drills to use with my students. I find the more I watch other people teach and read about rolling the better teacher I become.This book was not helpful to me at all. I am proficient at each of the rolling methods described in the book and half the time I still couldn't make sense of what the author was trying to explain. I found myself having to pause and really think about things before the passage I was reading would click. I could only follow because I have the background knowledge to know what he is trying to get at. I can't imagine being a beginner and trying to teach myself how to roll based on this book.Note that most of the 5 star reviews from this book are several years old. Paddling has changed a lot since '93, the copyright on my book. I would recommend a EJ's rolling and bracing as a much more up to date alternative to this book."
1,Uggghhhhh,"Such a great movie, but a horrible DVD release. The picture quality is awful and the sound is even worse. DO NOT BUY!"
1,Outrageous quality,"As someone mentioned already, you can't make much of the movie, as you can't hear, what they are talking about, as there are two sound tracks playing together, and subs are taking one third of the screen, as they are both english and chinese together and you can't switch them off. Otherwise the movie is okay, typical for that time and aim, so it's quite funny sometimes (in the good way), and sometime just silly - would get three stars, if you can see it at all. But stay away from this companys' products!!! For your own sake!"
1,a tragedy for the print industry.,"A poorly written story, the text is overly melodramatic and uninteresting. had the author made an attempt at developing her characters, it might have been less of a waste of my time to read.As it stands, the work is flat and pathetic. The main character is portrayed as a helpless victim throughout her poor little rich girl travels, never learning how to cope with the important people in her life.This book is a terrible waste of paper, ink & glue."
1,Mineral Palace,"This book was so filled with erroneous information that I couldn't focus on the author's craftsmanship. Although this was an Oprah book and received excellent critical reviews I was extremely offended by Miss Julavits' lack of responsible research. She wrote a book about a real town and real people but she distorted the facts. I lived in the town in l934 when the book was set and there was no resemblance to the actual town of Pueblo, Colorado or the people who lived there. I would not recommend this book to anyone."
1,A reader,"Ms Julavits should have, at least, visited Colorado prior to writing this novel. I am a native of Colorado Springs and found the description of that area very objectionable. Her description of Pueblo was even worse. Perhaps had I not been from this area I may have found the book to be a fair read--but perhaps not. The characters just weren't believable. I purchased the book because I wanted to read a book about the history of Pueblo. I knew it was a novel, but the majority of (good) historical novels have some basis in reality. I was very disappointed that this one did not."
1,"some truth, please?","...another book hyped by pal Dave Eggers here on Amazon, a site glitch revealed last year. I wonder which reviews are his; anyone know? This review spotting could be more fun than the book: look, there's hubby Ben Marcus's review! And pal/co-editor Vendela What's-her-name! Ooh--first one to spot Zadie Smith's wins! I just love this bold new 'indy' alternative to publishing."
1,Absolutely horrible.,"Cheating: The administrators of the game cheat for certain players and are don't enforce their own in-game rules unless more than 5 people complain.Gameplay: The game is designed so that it takes forever to level, literally weeks for one level after level 20 (max is 50).Performance: The game itself is highly intrusive, uses incredible amounts of memory, cpu, hard-disk space (4+gigs) and has many known issues with most graphics cards.Harassment: There is a lot of solicitation for joining various supergroups, a lot of unwanted invitations. Many people run around asking you for sex on this game if you play a female character.FEES: There is virtually NO technical support. It costs $15 per month to play this game, even after you buy it. Most people know this, but I do know one person who bought this game without realizing that.Bottom line: World of Warcraft is MUCH better. Heck, Warcraft III/TFT is better than this."
1,Doesnt Work,"This game disappointed me. I downloaded it and finally set up my account and then I created a really awesome character which took me an hour and a half to look through all the details. [horns,masks,suits,claws,powers,origins etc.] and then I pressed enter the rogue isles and the bottom half of my screen just freezes and the light effects make the top all blurry so I try a couple more times and I never got it to work. I contacted the tech support for the site and they just want me to run a diagnostic test and i dont know what the heck that is so I still havent become a villain..."
1,It didn't WoW me,"I was looking to take a break from world of warcraft and decided to give city villains a try... 2 weeks later I reactivated my warcraft account. I found the CoV gameplay to be extremely repetitive and chaotic. I also found the amount of supergroup/team spammed invites without so much as a 'hey' in-game tell to be infinitely bothersome. Maybe under different circumstances I could have enjoyed it - but it just didn't match up to world of warcraft... If I need to repetitevely kill the same things over and over and over again, I'd like to at least do it in a game where I can always move to a different setting and refresh the experience."
1,Must have internet connection,"This game is very fun to play. But you must have an internet connection in order to play it period. Description made it seem like you only needed it for online gameplay, but you need it period to even run the game and it costs $14.99 per month just play it. So it only get's two stars overall. I'm not an online gamer, so I found this to be very disappointing because I'm fan of the City of Heroes series."
1,Learn To Read,"Please don't buy the movie, buy the book. The movie is less than a foot note of the book. When I saw the movie had it not been for the fact that they mentioned Peter Straub's name, I would not have know it was based on his masterpiece. The book is THE ULTIMATE GHOST STORY whereas the best part about the movie is the all star cast.Unfortunately I have nothing good to say about this production."
1,I couldn't get into it,"I rarely don't finish a movie just because I keep hopes up that it may improve somewhat. I was very intrigued with this one as I was searching for a good ghost story that didn't overuse computer generated special effects and was just plain creepy. I was even more interested with the star-studded cast. The acting was great as I expected, but I just couldn't get into the storyline enough to finish it. I got through about 20 min. of it and all resemblance to a ghostly story was completely lost. It hit me much more as an older suspense/thriller movie. It also wasn't very well put together. Dream sequences, flashbacks, etc. made it difficult to follow. I was really disappointed with this one."
1,Instant Heat Lava Pads - one time usage only,"This product worked fairly well the first time. It got as hot as they described, but didn't retain that heat for very long. I followed the instructions to put heat back in the pads so I could use them again, but this did not work. I gave up after several trials with much disappointment. I am back to using the microwavable, one time use, or plug in heat."
1,lavapad,I bought 2! both don't work... after you use it once you can only use it again if you re-heat in boiling water. The lava pad gets hard as a rock after you put it in boiling water and let it cools down... You can't re-pop it.... !!! 10 thumbs DOWN... can the web site [...] doesn't exist.!!!!
1,Null & Void,"I am an African American dedicated to African magical traditions as a scholar, author, freelance writer and an artist. I keep trying to find more information about the author because I want to know WHO could have written such an empty book and got a publishing deal to boot. This book gets one star because the author must have used some ""voodoo"" on someone to get away with dispensing such misinformation.As several of the other reviewers, mention there is a very unsuccessful blend of different forms, not just traditions derived from Africa but also Europe and the Americas. European fairies and Vodou--am I missing something?The biggest warning and red flag is within the title itself, ""voodoo"" is a misnomer constructed by commercial interests like Hollywood--the proper name is Vodou or Vodoun. Come on Heiwu Okusu get a clue! If you know anything at all, you should realize that the ancestors loath disrespect! This book is reprehensible."
1,"Ghost story review-item not in condition for viewing, great movie non the less!","I remember watching this movie and wanted to see it again, so I ordered it, used. When I recieved it the amount of scratches on it would not allow it to play in my DVD player. I will still buy it but next time in better condition! I would not suggest anyone buy a DVD used, rather buy it in mint condition or at least real good condition. Thank you."
1,Too sexual,"I obviously had selective memory when it came to this movie, only remembering costumes, particularly scary scenes, production. I'd forgotten how the ghost seduced the men in the first half. Too much nudity & sexuality for me. It's a good story, & maybe I'm an old fogey now, but I'm going to give it to Goodwill."
1,Best Sex Scene Ever!!!,I haven't seen this movie since it appeared on HBO in the Fall of 1982 but I have fond memories of it. The scene that stands out most in my memory is the sex scene with Alice Kringe and her boyfriend. FANTASTIC!!!!! I wish this DVD wasn't out-of-print!
1,HORRIFYINGly bad.,"This has to be the worst horror film I have seen in a long time. It is utterly boring, and anti-climatic at best.I expected to see a horror film about a haunted old house full of wierd sounds and eerie happenings (like ""The Haunting"")....no such luck. A description like that sounds weak, but would have been better than this waste of time. And if any ""big haunted houses"" show up in ""Ghost Story"", the images are jumbled, boring, and annoying.The only plus in this movie is Alice Kridge.Avoid this one."
1,Boring...boring,"This movie has an intersting story line, but its soooo boring. I wouldn't recommend BUYING it, unless you are a Saratoga Buff... it was filmed there and the houses are beautiful!"
1,Essential Guitar: 33 Guitar Masterpieces,"Although entitled ""Guitar Masterpieces"" the music is MOSTLY big band with some guitar lead. This CD does not feature the guitar. Very disappointing....."
1,What an uncomfortable mix!,"If you want to get confused, do not hesitate to buy this book !! You will find in it tattwas and rune practices, siberian chamanism, pranayama, buddhists mantras, the evocation of yidams, etc... This is a perfect, but rather unhelpful ""pot pourri"" of various religious and magickal traditions. The book is therefor rather useless and rather expensive regarding his (poor) content."
1,things go DUD in the night,"first the good points of the movie,john houseman,douglas fairbanks jr.,melvyn douglas,and fred astaire! while not the best proformances these men ever gave it is great to see these old pro's at in again.now the bad news, they are saddled with a script that gives them nothing to do and even these gentelmen's talent can't make anything of value out of this mess about four elderly men who meet and tell ghost stories even as a ghost of a long ago shared sin is comeing back to haunt them. the story moves forward at a the pace snail and just dosen't ever pull you in.a wasted chance,but 2 stars for the 4 old pros and the little life that the movie has is because of them."
1,"Nice try, but no cigar (or whiskey)!","After reading this book, I've concluded that the only truly accurate part of this book occurs within the first 50 pages. That's when this author gives the names of the Loa. The rest of the book turns into so much ""McWitch-isms"" (tm A. L. Drew) that it's PAINFUL to read. Voodoo ""Pentagrams""? Using of ""chalices and athames""? And the worst parts of all, do Voudouisants really use NORSE RUNES in their rites?!!You're better off reading Zora Neale Hurston's ""Tell My Horse"" for more accurate portrayals of Vodou religion than this book. My (cautious) congratulations to the author for getting his/her work published, but I can't in good conscience recommend this books as an accurate ""instruction book"" on how to practice the Vodou religion."
1,a good attempt but not a good artwork,"The artist, 18 when producing this debut wordless novel, attempts to depict the situations of the dehumanized, angry citizen under sadistic regime in the industrial wasteland. It is a good try but the artwork is a bit dull and flat in most of the pieces. One star for the attempt and another for the idea."
1,LAME GHOST STORY !!!,"I just bought this DVD, because all these hip an all. Man was lame as hell. Wasn't real horror AT ALL ,more was lame, then horror, I know what I am talking about because I am fan of a ghost and haunted type movies...Wish I could get my damn money back..If u really wants to see a ghost, haunted house and also is kind of classic is same years with this movie made? .get""The Entity""...I just bought ""ENTITY"" and I saw it back in 80s,Is real true chilling ghost story,& got me real shocked. Worth every penny I paid. Skip this lame trash,U would disappointed!!"
1,Sad...,"what a waste of good paper and ink, not to mention the loss of a small part of my life that i'll never get back. if your looking to learn Haitian Vodou or even New Orleans Voodoo for that matter, i would suggest Voodoo for Dummies before this trash lol. sad, sad, sad...how embarrassing."
1,"A ""User's Guide""? ....I think not.","First off it seems a little insulting to think that one could read a ""User's Guide"" and some how think they know anyting about a very old and established religion. Secondly, this is a POOR ""user's guide"".To lump various spiritual/cultural practices under the label of ""Voodoo"" does not do the actual RELGION of Vodoun justice. This book seems to be motivated by what the author likes to THINK voodoo is, than what it TRULY is. Voodoo has nothing to do with Wicca, nor any other New Age spirituality."
1,One of the WORST books ever.,"The only reason I finished this book was to see if something interesting was EVER going to happen. It NEVER did. This book is a waste of time. The book was HORRIBLE. I think the author should look into a new career, maybe writing obituaries."
1,A dull and unrealistic story.,"How is it that a dying town, ravaged by the harshness of the physical and economic climate of the 1930's, managed to support a seemingly thriving prostitution business? And was there a faithful spouse in Pueblo? It appears not. The characters of Bena and Ted were odd and quite unbelievable. One wonders how they ever got together at all.Julavits has placed far too much emphasis on the physical side of human nature. The characters are mostly portrayed in psycho-sexual terms and very little else.The plot meanders far too long and the ending is flat as the Colorado plains."
1,Missing her trademark,"Julavits is certainly an unusual author. She's not the best at making believable, relatable characters, and she doesn't quite succeed in pulling the reader in to the story -- usually you feel more like a disjointed spectator.However, she does a fabulous job of playing these little mind games with you that make you question your own reality, question people's motives, and ultimately makes the book almost an interactive experience to the text because your interpretation of events affects the story that takes place.She did an excellent job of this in The Effect Of Living Backwards, and a decent job in The Uses of Enchantment. Unfortunately, this book contained the shortcomings of her writing without the strengths. You still feel a lack of empathy for the characters and a disjointedness from the setting, but the story is missing her trademark psychological elements. I guess it didn't become her trademark until later."
1,Did I actually get BabyLuxe?,"Hi. I was very excited about getting some shirts for my daughter, but when I received the ten shirts I ordered I was a little upset that they had no tags on them and the second tag on the inside of the shirt was cut from all the shirts. The invoice stated that to return any items they had to be new, but how could they be returned if they did not come with tags? Also, the fact that one of the inside tags was cut makes me think that these shirts are not Babyluxe brand, but some other brand that you, as the seller, acquired and jacked up the price.I will be posting this same comment as a review of your item because I think buyers need to be aware of what they are really getting.The shirts are cute, but it makes me wonder if I received what I really bought."
1,Worst Bottle Opener Ever,"In theory, this is a great little tool. I like how they tried to fit multiple useful functions into one compact item (though I only count 3 or 4, not the advertised 6).In practice, this thing is awful. The main problem is that the bottle-opener functionality is backwards and misshapen. Because it's backwards, you don't get any leverage when you're trying to open a bottle and the point of the knife end can dig into your hand. And because it's misshaped, it pokes a hole in the cap before opening it and generally takes 3 different angles to actually get the cap off.I can't comment on the other functions, because I threw this junk away after it made me spill Coke all over."
1,This book stinks. I got a refund,"The book is replete with errors, ommisions, and distorted information, escpecially when it comes to pricing on Fiestaware. I thought I was buying a quality reference book. I was wrong. I found my receipt on this book, which I purchased in October, 1997. Here in February, 1998, I took the book back. My money was cheerfully refunded. I was so surprised by the content of this book that I will never again by a book written by this author, nor by the publisher. Sorry. If you don't believe me, my only advice is to hang on to your receipt if you anyway buy this book. Thank you."
1,Nice pictures of vintage...,"This book as some interesting info but not great. The book is 97% Fiestaware, most of that being the vintage pieces.Being a collector of the post 86 Fiestaware, the book didn't do much for me."
1,jessica fletcher,"Same story line as murder she wrote, with sex.Stupid writer and very stupid police-woman manage crime. Not very good really.tlt-"
1,Complete Change of Style and Sound,"Not to echo too many of the reviews here, but I have to say ""THIS IS NOT THE SAME BAND."" With the exception of Trevor's recognizable vocals, not one thing on this album would lead me to believe that this was FTF. Not one. It's an attempt, albeit a poor one, at Top 40 mainstream alt-rock. FTF is no longer a punk band, folks. Stick with Big Choice or their self-titled."
1,This is the worst stuff I have heard in a long time,"No offense to Face to Face or anything but this is the worst CD ever made. After making such a good LIVE CD, you come out with this poo. Do not get this but if you want to get a Face to Face CD, get LIVE because it is really good."
1,What in the hell happened to these guys??,"this album is without a doubt a total, and i mean total disappointment...... its not that its not fast its just that there is no rhythm any more... i regret buyin this... if u buy any face to face i recommend buying any of there old stuff.. but not this"
1,Classic Red - REALLY?,"This is an ugly dark purplish pink, no where near red even though it says Classic Red on the label.Also it does not feel moist, it feels dry after just a few seconds. Very disappointed."
1,Why?,"I really don't understand why this show was released only in standard definition. The show was filmed in high definition (the HD format is available on Video on Demand).Also, I don't understand why was used so high compression for the video the stream (3 hours and half per disc!!).Of course I can't buy this DVD release. Hopefully, soon the Blu-ray version will be released."
1,dvd will not olay,"the dvd will not play, bought a new dvd player b/c it would play on my old one, still won't play"
1,Where is the Blu-ray of CASTLE?!,"The show and season deserves 5 stars without a doubt. However the low 2-star ranking is done in hopes that someone somewhere will see this review and release the season on Blu-ray! The series is shot in HD, and is an intelligent, thought provoking, witty show...but then they think the customer's intelligence stops at the couch and we will not notice that they just released it on DVD?! I did not watch it in SD on cable, why dumb down my viewing now?!Where is the Blu-ray release of Castle? I refuse to purchase this great series until it comes out on Blu. The fact they are taking so long, also means they have potentially lost a buy if it EVER does come out on Blu-ray. Had the Blu-ray version come out on the DVD release day, I would have been the first to add it to my cart!!"
1,lipstick,When I placed the order it indicated the lipstick was a 2-pack. When I received it the order was a single tube of lipstick. Had I know this I would not have order from this vendor.
1,Why Change?,"Well...after waiting, and waiting and then waiting some more for this cd to come out...it finally did. I must say that the change was definitely not a plus in my book. The live album was SO good. My favorite live album by far. Now I'm afraid to go to a live show. I don't want to fall asleep. I don't hate this cd...I do like about half the songs, but it just isn't Face to Face. I certainly hope your musical tastes change once again, back to where they were."
1,To Each his own,"Well, it's funny how they went from a fast Cali-punk to a more emotional filled rock. It is not something I pictured Trevor Keith to ever do. Now, change is good because it shows the band has balls and the courage to do it. However, I think Face to Face went a little extreme on this album. Its not as fast, has a lot of different instruments tracks then before and shows a lot more to the band than the 3 chord songs on their previous albums. Basically the music is cool, but sometimes Trevor Keith's voice clashes with the music, making it sometimes annoying to hear. Id say buy it if you ve always been a big fan because it's good to see bands evolve over time. However, if you just picked up on them, I'd say keep away from this and stick to Green Day."
1,castle: first season,i would love to give a review on castle: the first season and i should be able to as i was suppose to have gotten it on 9/27/10 but i have not yet received it and despite writing numerous times as to what the hold up is have only been told by sparks that they cannot find a record of my order even when i've sent them the order number. i will say i have enjoyed the show castle on tv however. i do look forward to owning the dvd
1,"Great Writing, Not Face To Face......","As usual, the songwriting by Trevor Keith is excellent. But, there is only one problem: This isn't the same Face To Face that recorded Don't Turn Away, Big Choice, Over It, Face To Face, and Face To Face Live, almost literally! Two of the three original Face To Face members are gone (Rob Kurth-Drums, and Matt Riddle-Bass). I expected more high energy, punk rock from Ignorance Is Bliss. I think that it's really terrible what this album did to the band. It's way to much of a change all at once. i really enjoyed the album, but I'd rather hear this music from the Foo Fighters on Third Eye Blind, not Face To Face. I was very upset and disappointed with this album. I hope that if Face To Face releases another album, it's more like Don't Turn Away, and not this %$#&! Reccomended songs: Overcome, Burden, Heart of Hearts, and I Know What You Are. If you are a first-time Face To Face buyer, buy Don't Turn Away (and read my review on it) Review By: Joseph Palazzo"
1,I hope it was an itch they scratched,"Well, I must say that this album does have a couple of good songs on it. I personally liked ""Overcome"" and ""Burden."" But all the rest of the songs are some sappy, overdone things that you'll probably skip over after the first 30 seconds.The syphonic sound with strings layered over the wimpy guitars are way out of character. I felt like Yanni and Kenny G hijacked this project.I was just beginning to believe that intergrity existed in the music industry, and they go and sell out. Oh well. I hope it was just an itch that they scratched, and they'll get back to making F2F music. If you want a good Face To Face album, get their self-titled CD. That one's got drive and energy on every song. It's 100 times better than Ignorance is Bliss."
1,From fast paced punk to failed emo band.,"It's kind of sad. Most of the bands that I loved have been making a steady decline. With Face to Face, it was so sudden, like hitting a brick wall. Don't get me wrong, I love emo, but this was awful. I'd like to suggest any Sunny Day Real Estate or Get Up Kids album instead of this. Words cannot express the horror that I felt when I listened to this album."
1,Different is NOT better,"I anticipated the release of the new face to face studio album for 2 years. When I first put the disc into my cd player, my heart sunk. I had feelings of dread in the back of my mind ever since I read Trevers post on the web site about a ""different"" type of CD. I couldn't believe this was happening. I never heard of a band changing their sound, in their prime. I guess you could say the move took courage, but it wasn't a good idea. Although I have to admit there are several songs on the CD which are quite good, they're not interesting. The bottom line is that the reason face to face was so great is that they had their own niche in the world of music. They were the only band that could write such great melodies with such amazing punk energy. This is why they were one of my favorite bands. Now they're just another rock band. Weather the songs are good or not, there's something missing."
1,Face to Face Discuss the Next Album,"From Face to Face's web page, about the new album they are working on: ""I think many of you will be pleased to know that this next record will be a bit more raw and stripped down than ""Ignorance is Bliss."" If I had to give an example of what some of the songs are sounding like I guess I would say they are influenced by bands like Fugazi, Jawbreaker, The Clash, etc. It's definitely going to be a more familiar sounding album to most F2F fans, but not predictable.""At least they can admit how horrible this album was! I give them credit for that. :-)"
1,I wouldn't buy this album if it were in the 99 cents bin,"Do not buy this album. I know what you're thinking, how could it be bad, it's Face to Face? Well, it's awful. If you are a Face to Face fan and haven't heard this album, DON'T LISTEN TO IT! You will loose all respect for the band. You will grow frustrated and bitter and lead an unfulfilling life. In other words, you will be living in a van down by the river. Don't let it happen to you!"
1,WENT TO SOFT ROCK R.I.P,"THis was one of MY favorite bands in the word. Everyone who has reviewed it say that it is from there hearts. I personally think they went soft for the money. Just like unwritten law and sugar ray. these bands use to rock hard core. Once they see that if they slowed it down a little they can reach out to more of a wider group of listeners. I love face to face. WHen i saw this in the store i about wet my pants. When i put it in the cd, A BIG DISAPPOINTMENT. LONG LIVE FACE TO FACE."
1,What the #$*! happened to these guys?,"Well. I bought this cd with such high hopes, thinking that Ignorance is Bliss would be an incredible album, but, I was wrong. It reminds me of soft sounding Pearl Jam songs. The song writing isn't even that strong. I can't think of anything decent to say about this. I'm sure a couple people who are die hard Face to Face fans will read this and think to themselves that I'm just pissed off because its not fast, but thats not the case at all. It just doesn't catch one bit of my attention. I recomend to anyone who wants to buy a Face to Face album, that they get any of their older ones, just don't make the mistake I made and spend money on this cd."
1,Not One Good Song on the Whole Album,"I've listened to this album over and over, and with each listen it breaks my heart. Why, oh, why did they have to sell out? Now there are some people who claim that this new sound is good, and that is exactly what they were working for. To get people who know nothing about good music to buy their album. These people are called ""the general public"", and this was their target audience. If you want to listen to good Emo, buy Diary. If you want a failed attempt at a mainstream crossover, buy Ignorance is Bliss."
1,Do not buy this -Jult Warfell,"I had no high hopes for this series and true to my opinion, I was sadly dead on. Words cannot display how much time I invested watching this and its second half, not to mention the cabbage I wasted purchasing the two. -Jult Warfell"
1,I felt like if I had lost a friend,"THE GREAT PUNK IS OVER. WHAT WAS FOR A DECADE THE GREATEST BAND, IS NOW COMPLETELY LOST. IN THIS ALBUM YOU CAN NOTICE THE ""FACE TO FACE"" BACK THERE... SOMEWHERE, BUT IS LIKE IF THAT FIRE IN THEIR SPIRIT HAD RAN OFF."
1,Cheap product,"This item broke the first time my husband put it together. One of the screws did not fit in the hole on the bar, and the screw broke from its handle while trying to get it in (making one of the bars unuseable). You get what you pay for with this product."
1,Is this a joke?,"I waited so long for some new face to face. I picked up the CD right when it came out but when I put it in my stereo the strangest thing happened. There was NO Face to Face!!! All I heard was some Collective Soul and some Oasis. I guess replacing Rob Kurth as their drummer was the last straw. Their unique fast-powerful-melodic style was obviously the product of ex-band members Matt Riddle and Rob Kurth. I did give ""Ignorance is Blss"" one star however because Trevor now has a beautiful quiver in his voice at the end of each line- just like N'Sync (how nice). This album is not horrible but it is NOT Face to Face. It is really slow and really weak. Profound lyrics can not save it. If you like old Face to Face style punk- PLEASE TRUST ME- You will NOT like this CD. I have been a huge fan for years and still am a huge fan, of the real Face to Face."
1,One star is more than it deserves.,"Face to Face tries to cash in on the ""emo"" craze. Unfortunately, they can't pull it off. It just sounds like their previous albums slowed down and sans the energy that we have come to associate with F2F. Trever tries to create some psuedo-intellectual, pretentious lyrics that he probably thinks is needed for this kind of music, but its just cliched trash."
1,Tried and tried again...no can do!,"We tried twice to watch this show. The first time we got through 2 episodes and just couldn't take it anymore. After several months and reading the rave reviews, we tried again. We got through 4 shows this time. We found the daughter is by far the most interesting character. The mother has some merits. The rest is simply bad acting and bad writing. For example in the 4th or 5th episode the bad guy comes into the room blazing. Our fine detective is on the phone to her office. What do you hear in the background as the heros are ducking and diving...""call 911.""We gave up after the lame poker sub-plot."
1,horrific,"When i purchased this cd I put complete confidence in my favorite band of the time, FTF. I was utterly dissapointed with my purchace. I bought a fifteen doller single.(I know what you are being the only good song on the cd.) I never would have thought that FTF would turn classic rock to get a shot at the mainstreem. I thought maybe I would keep it for my new romance cd- to slow dance to and all, but only because dico-round won't give me any money for it. I love FTF, but this isn't Face to Face- it's Trevor Keith's Anthology. Don't buy it"
1,the worst book ever made,"I think this book was horrible, after the bad story line and winy kids you want to light the book on fire. I was forced to read this book and I'm only in 8th grade. One thing I would have change is the ending, after enduring all that time thinking that they were finally going to become men. They kill there leader and make them all become babies again. I think this book was a waste of money and a waste of paper. This book infuriates me; it makes me want to throw up. With the presents of some comedy this book might have been funnier but no they had to make the worst book ever wrote. The story line is that these kids see these buffalo getting slatered, and these kids go up and try and break them out. And on the way cotton, Teft, goodenow, Lally 1 and 2 and Shecker get in some hijacked cars and shooting out some tires, and once they get there they almost fail but some how cotton comes up with this marvelous plan and sacrifices himself to save animals."
1,Could it get any more boring,"I read the book in English class and it was very pointless. I did not like the plot of the story or the setting. The say in the book, ""You send us a criminal, will send you a cowboy."" More like ""You make us read this book, and will make you pay a penny for it."""
1,6 pack?,"I purchased an order for a 6 pack of this canvas and received only 1 instead. Great, a $30 dollar canvas."
1,Terrorize Brutalize Sodomize = 5 STARS! Metalblade = 0 STARS! where's the DVD?,"i'm really sick of getting cheated out of bonus discs and bonus dvds by the U.S. releases. Metalblade US sent out a notice that they will no longer promote their European releases in the US by sending out promotional copies for review/internet radio, etc. they would only concentrate on 'un-Metal' (which is my wordplay for Nu-Metal/Mall-core) on the US counterpart of Metalblade. little did i expect that also meant not releasing CD's with the added bonuses that Metalblade in Europe released. Vomitory ""Terrorize Brutalize Sodomize was released with a bonus DVD of alive show from La Laiterie, Strasbourg 04/04/03. this isn't the only release the US label cheats us American supporters, and unfortunately, it won't be the last."
1,Dull and drawn out,"This book could be fully and completely told in 3 sentences or less, yet it is drawn out in an uneventful tale that is supposed to be suspenseful, but is generally unappealing. Although the linkage to the Bible is somewhat interesting, it loses its effect in this dull novel. I don't reccomend anyone waste their precious time reading about a group of boys going on a nightlong joyride."
1,Very useful tools packed into a brillient design too bad I can't open it.,Very clever design. Passes airport security every time. The tools are perfect for small jobs which is all I need. I have had this tool for 3 1/2 years. Initially I could open and close it with my fingers; now I am a bit older and I need a tool to open it up. If they made a new easy open model I would buy it.
1,Captain of My Heart,"This will probably be my last book by this author. An unlikable heroine, an accident prone hero, added to an impossible plot, equals not very good."
1,The Beasts And Children,"My thoughts on the climax of the book are that I did not like the book's climax at all. The climax was when the six boys let the buffalo out of the pens. The characters were OK. The six main characters are Cotton the oldest child, Lally1 the oldest Lally brother, Lally2 the other Lally brother,Teft the only one that could drive, Shecker the fatest one , and Goodnow who who wets the bed. The setting of the story was OK. The story was set in Arizona. The flash backs are a major point in the story. There had to be about 70 of them in the whole book.If you are wondering the point of view is in 1st person point of view. Finally, symbolism,there was not a whole ton of symbolism in this story."
1,What happened to the cool face to face?,"As soon as i popped in the cd, i thought, ok...they have a slow song, it's decent, but its not punk. By the time I was 8 songs through, I realized that this is not going to pick up. Face to Face fans will be shocked to find a totally different band playing. This album truly disappointed me as i'm sure it will others."
1,RIP F2F,"I don't recommend this album. All of Face to Face's previous ablums are far superior to this wannabe emo-core cd. If you want to listen to good emo, try Sunny Day Real Estate or Jimmy Eat World. If you want to listen to good melodic punk, listen to any F2F album previous to this one."
1,A giant step backward,"This album is a drastic departure from F2F records of the past. However, this is by no means a good thing. It appears that face to face has decided to sell out in favor of a larger audience (and more record sales)."
1,NOT EMPRESSED,"I'm not wild about the series. Every episode I've seen has been lifted from some other show, mainly BONES."
1,This album ruined Face to Face forever.,"Don't buy this album. Don't buy any previous Face to Face album either, even though the previous albums were great. Face to Face needs to be punished for this crime against humanity. I'm just glad that this attempt to reach a wider audience has blown up in their faces. No new audience will accept it and their old audience has now rejected them because of it. The loose out on every level. Ha ha ha ha! Whah.. ha ha ha ha......."
1,the worst CD I have purchased in the last 5 years,I could not believe how bad this CD was. I liked the last one but I could tell they were trying to progress and go in another direction. Its the wrong direction completely. They should stop recording and just play live if they are going to keep getting worse then this CD.
1,Surprisingly Awful.,"F2F has changed their sound, and it is not for the better. I was a big F2F fan until this album came out, but now that the band has made this album I have given up on them. Not only is it the worst kind of popular trash (imagine taking 3eb, The Goo Goo Dolls, and Matchbox 20, and puting them in a blender) , but it illustrate a complete lack of integrity. I don't recommend buying this album, or any other F2F albums for that matter. This is a band that deserves no support."
1,AWEFULll!!!!!',This book sucks so bad iTs about 14 year olds that piss themselves really... Unless its for school do not buy this aweful book
1,A wierd book that keeps you on the edge,"Bless the Beasts and Children is a book I would not reccomend to anyone. Even though it may keep you on the edge of your seat. You always are wanting to know what stupid things the"" bed wetters"" are going to do next. The Flashbacks are confusing and the characters are obviously mis-fits that need a life. If you like the stories about adolescence in need of attention. read this book."
1,it has nothing to do with maturity,"writing songs like this really doesn't have much to do with maturity. Face to Face was once a great band (Don't Turn Away was by far the greatest), but as a long time punk fan, Face to Face was never really very hard core. Very energetic, but not hard at all. I think I was just about as disppointed when Big Choice came out. They never should have left Fat.So this change doesn't really surprise me. Most of my friends stopped listening to F2F after Don't Turn Away. I guess I stop after the self titled (which blows Big Choice out of the water)."
1,lousy,"bought cover girl power pink lipstick, i get more color from a chapstick, can't even tell i put it on, price was low, still got jipped"
1,egh!,It wasn't what I expected. It was too glittery for my taste. But I was satisfied with the s&h. Instead I bought the Saint Germain lipstick from MAC. Now that's more of what I was going for.
1,I thought this was supposed to be face to face?,"Well I have to be honest. This one leaves me unimpressed. I was all excited, as usual, when I saw that face to face had another one coming out. Naturally I was expecting more of the sound that I love. But unfortunately, you wont find it here. I understand that musicians want to grow, want to do something different once in a while, but sometimes it just doesn't work. This is one of those times.I have to admit that I really didn't give it much of a chance. Maybe it is better than I think after all. But the only way that is possible, I think, is if you listen to it and try to forget that it is face to face you are listening to.Otherwise, if you are looking for anything like, say, ""Nothing"", hearing this one makes you think you will never hear anything like it again from this band."
1,Everyone....the Face to Face has gone bad.,"I guess this is what age does to good punk bands. It's a shame, I tell you. They used to be good. They used to be real good."
1,1-Star Emo,"I doubt that the individual who wrote the review titled ""Five-Star Emo"" has even a vauge conception of what Emo is. To those who think this is a great album, I guess ignorance IS bliss."
1,It's bad!!!!!!,"To think I used to like this band. The only good song is Prodigal. Even then its just a mediocre song. What happened? What about don't turn away. I'm sorry but this is just bad. It's week, slow, boring, and all around bad"
1,Talk about a 180,"This album was nothing I hoped it would be. They sound like the 90's version of Bon Jovi on this album. Don't get me wrong, I'm a huge Face to Face fan and loved every album before this one, but this is unbelieveable. I was really in shock when I thought how I wasted my money buying a Face to Face record. I never thought it was possible, but it happens. I still love there other albums."
1,"Impossible to turn knobs, awful sound quality","I bought this and after using it a few times, I wish I would not have bought it.Knobs are impossible to turn when wet (small, round and smooth) just what you DON'T want in a shower radio.When you turn it on, it goes from no sound to BLASTING with the smallest adjustment. Nearly impossible to get a non-deafening level.Does stay on the tuned station, drifts up and down.Look for another model."
1,The Worst Album I've Ever Heard,"Face to Face has gone emo, and while I do love emo, they are terrible at it. This album should have never been made."
1,A Face to Face fan,"Ignorance is Bliss is the kind of punk you buy at the Gap. Totally off track! I understand that they are trying to grow, but their oldies are goodies!"
1,I Don't Think So !!!!!!!!,"WELL, I must say that this book is on my list of books I say were painful to read, heck PAINFUL to finish. The writing did seem adolescent and didn't have solid findings as it went on . There were too many discrepancis and so it seemed, not logical research had been used.I am an avid reader and I am firm on not going to the back of the book nor do I stop it the middle, because the book, well,... sucks. This was the second book that I had to cheat on, due to it's unrealistic and very predictable plot. It was the first book by P.M. that I have read, I am a bit disappointed. Would I rate this higher the 1, I don't think so!"
1,Sleeping Beauty,"Margolin is a long time favorite writer of mine, however, in ""Sleeping Beauty"" with its never ending cast of characters, and convoluted plot, I feel I could crawl into bed with the sleeping beauty and join her in her comotose condition and not miss anything. My brain can only take so much and in this rendition Philip has burned me out.We have the rape of Tanya, the murder of Terri, the murders of Ashley's police guardians, and then, finally when Casey Van Meter emerges from here coma the killer makes an attempt on her life. He is finally caught, convicted and sentenced to death...hooray!! Wow, in retrospect I wonder if it would have ended better if Casey had joined all the murder victims.E.J. Walden, author of ""Operation Snow Owl"""
1,Really....,"I know that this is a story, and with that comes some parts where you need to allow your brain to let go of certain things that you know as reality. This book became almost monotonous to read...This was my first read from this author - and will certainly be my last. The plot was as if a ten year old wrote it, and the characters were all horrible! I did not enjoy this read at all."
1,dont bother,works fine to soften dry under eye skin but doesnt help either puffiness or dark circles. any lotion could do the same thing. not worth the money!
1,Ho Hum!!,"I've read several good books by Phillip Margolin and either I've grown away from his style, or this book is really boring! With an unbelievable plot and cardboard characters, there's very little I can recommend."
1,not good,"I have to echo the previous comments regarding the wooden dialogue and two dimensional characters. This book had such a good premise, but Mr. Margolin hasn't taken much effort to flesh out his characters. They are typical ""stock"" mystery type characters: the gutsy survivor/heroine who falls in love with her tender young savior. The sassy, nurturing and buxom black female district attorney. The sinister and wily bad guys. And some of the legal details within the story are not plausible. I just wish the writer had put more effort into developing characters, it's tiring reading about such stereotypical people."
1,Disappointed,This looks like the same color on for a little bit-- then when it's almost gone it goes to a funny orange. I'm thinking its a knock- off or something. I still had a small amt. left of an original and it sure didn't do what this lipstick did. My husband asked-- what do you have on your lips-- he rarely notices a thing...
1,Not a good source for treatment options...,"I was recently diagnosed with Sjogrens and have now read most of the books out there. This one, while good with the emotional issues of dealing with a chronic illness, is severely lacking if you are looking for treatment options. Yes, it provides the standard treatments for dry eyes and dry mouth (as do pretty much all of the sources out there) but if you have any additional manifestations whatsoever (especially extraglandular issues) you will find no help here. Yes, it does tell you that Sjogrens can affect your lungs, for example, but it goes no further than that (no treatments to pursue, no suggestions whatsoever). There are much better books for your money (for the most comprehensive quick-read try Positive Options for Sjogrens Syndrome by Sue Dyson)."
1,Overview of Sjogren's Syndrome,If you knew nothing about Sjogren's this would be the book for you. I had read about this syndrome online so it really didn't tell me anything I didn't already know.
1,Junk!,"I bought the Swiss-Tech Utili-Key 6-in-1 keyring tool at Wal-mart. I dropped it once, and it broke in half!I don't mean it broke at the pivot point, but the metal itself broke! The model number of it is UKCSB-2. It mayhave been made as lower quality for Wal-mart, because I notice that a similar product sold at Amazon is model UKCSB-1.The price wasn't much different than the similar product at Fred Meyer, though.I will avoid all Swiss-Tech products in the future."
1,Don't waste your money !!,Terrible writing. Flat characters . Boring plot. Like reading a high schoolers' attempt at a novel. Couldn't finish it. Life is too precious and there are too many good books out there waiting for me to read them !!
1,This is not literature,"While the plot intrigued me somewhat (enough to finish it), I couldn't stop screaming at the pages about how far-fetched it was. The author didn't seem to have his own voice, making a stereotype out of every character, whether it was a jolly black female, goodie two shoes attorney, innocent maiden or an ice-queen mother. I am reluctant to believe that this writer had written better books before, if he did, he must have had a really bad writer's block to plagiarize someone else's work this time!"
1,bummer,"broke the first time i used it , screwdriver part didnt handle bit of torg , there is an warranty so im sending it back and we will see what happens ??"
1,"Should make the list ""Worst books ever published.""","Simply awful writing, immature, as if written by a teenager instead of a previously published author. The chapters were back and forth from one time period to another, difficult to follow.In the book, Miles tells his readers at a book signing that authors should ""Show, not tell."" But Phillip Margolin did not follow that advice. He told, told, told, boring statements such as... He looked stunned. She felt awful. She was startled. He looked angry. She looked happy. In one instance, ""His eyes dropped to the table."" Ouch, that must have hurt.Don't waste your time on this book. Why it ever got published is beyond understanding."
1,Good idea poor quality,Mine broke within 2 weeks of having on my keychain. The metal loop that attaches to the keychain broke clean off. Look for a better quality tool elsewhere.
1,Weak magnets = very fragile construction,"We purchased this set and another smaller set for my three year old son for Christmas. I was skeptical that these could be better than the Legos that I myself grew up with, and for good reason. The magnets on Magna Tiles are, in my estimation, very weak. They just barely hold any of your building projects together and, like a house of cards, only the smallest bump will cause the whole thing to collapse. You'll spend far more time picking up the pieces than you will enjoying the final product. Forget about using the car for anything substantial; you won't be able to ""drive"" it once you build on it.More permanent building-block style toys are far better than these Magna Tiles. I would return them if I could."
1,What the hell was Ark21 thinking?,"I purchased this album because I wanted to support a local artist, since he lives right in my city. Primarily, I picked it up because it was on the Ark 21 Records label, who has consistently put out really interesting hip hop releases, that are at least what I'd consider meat and potatoes, fundamental hip hop, with a little more towards the experimental side every once in a while. This album was super disappointing. It's so cliche and unoriginal, so different from what this record company is used to. If you're expecting something up to the normal Ark 21 standards, don't purchase this album. Even for the gangster style it barely pulls off, the rhymes are average, less than intimidating or entertaining, and the beats are too old school with that synthesizer cheese. If you want something from the traditional gangster style similar to these small independent gangster labels, then definitely listen to the sound clips first, cause I still wouldn't recommend it."
1,WORTHLESS,"This stuff is a waste of money. It did nothing for my somewhat damaged hair,...except make it really difficult to comb and dry looking and stiff,..and limp. Everything a bad shampoo would do. I have never liked Tigi products so I don't know why I bought this. Probably to assure me that nothing works as well as Klorane shampoos & conditioners,.which Im sticking to from now on. No sulfates either."
1,Not what I'd like for it to have been,"I thought this CD was going to feature Don singing with these fellas. There was no singing at all. Just instrumental. On some of the songs you can't even tell Don is in there anywhere. The instrumentals I guess are ok, but I'd like to have heard more of Don. As a matter of fact, when I first got it, I didn't think he was even involved. That is until today when I got my boxed set - 1960-1966, when I saw that Los Indios Tabajaras is actually on these CDs. Maybe I'll listen to it again and do a new review. Until then, I don't like it."
1,janet's losing it,following mike;s footsteps this shows anything can sell now this is one of the worst songs this year next.
1,Awful.,"Singing? Um no, it's a lot of repetitive talking. My kids BEGGED me to turn it off so I dropped it of at the thrift store. Hopefully somebody else can find good use of it. I've found a ton of better state/capital songs for FREE on youtube."
1,"Not engaging, not useful","I had high hopes for this CD, as I'd like a fun way to teach my kids the states. However, the ""songs"" are mostly kids speaking the words (not singing) with a musical background. The details about the states are not consistent -- for example, for one state you learn when it became a state, for another, what its state flower is (how is that relevant to what the state is like?) and yet another, the major crops or the weather. It's useless as music, and useless as learning. The Animaniacs ""States"" song is much more engaging; I think I'll teach that one to my kids."
1,Not All That Good,The album version is the best version on this single. This song is a peaceful song. The dance remixes aren't doing this song any justice. Just stick to the original.
1,Just Not Interesting...,"I agree with the reviewer's title ""Merely An Okay Read,"" in that this story was quite dull and if not for Nicholas & Eleanor it would really have tanked. This Leander had zilch for personality."
1,Wrong Filter,"It was so convenient that Amazon provided pull-down menus to help you find the perfect filter for your vehicle. Too bad it's the wrong filter.This filter does not fit a 2004 Ford Escape 3.0 XLT no matter what they say. I needed to purchase something for around $4.00 at Christmastime to get free shipping. Although I didn't need it yet, I ordered the filter. Now it's February, past the return date, and the filter doesn't fit. Just be careful when using Amazon's part finder."
1,Not worth buying,"Couldn't give it 0 stars or would have. Disappointing read from beginning. Writing style was elementary, characters were two dimensional, dialog was stilted and unnatural. Figured out real murderer early on. Forced myself to read the whole book because I had paid for it. Test of endurance. Major blooper on page 313 (hardback version) - even editors and proofers had quit reading by then. Don't waste your time."
1,"Good product, just too pricey.","Since I could not post that the product is too pricey at the recently raised price I'm going to lie and say it is nicely priced so I will not get an e-mail telling me my review could not be posted because I put truth, and was well within all guidelines with what my review said before...I gues you have to say something good to get a review posted? SAD"
1,Usefulness depends upon area studying,"This book was not nearly as helpful as I expected it to be. The photographs and drawings seemed like they would be really helpful. However, I found it very confusing to try to figure out which picture corresponded to what my specimen actually looked like. It was most helpful for muscles, and least helpful for nerves and vessels. It is also very time consuming to look up the particular item and then flip through many pages looking for a picture that shows your item of interest clearly."
1,Not Recommended,"Yes, it was under $15. But, it is overpriced at that amount. The mirror fogs. The radio won't stay on station. Buy something else."
1,Skip this shower radio,"I got this shower radio for Christmas and was excited. Also, the radio is only splash proof and can only withstand a small amount of steam. Because of this I didn't feel comfortable hanging it directly under the shower head by the rope, so I used the suction cups and placed it at the far end of the shower. But, I was constantly afraid that the suction cups would fail and the radio would fall. I used it exactly TWICE (total time was about 30 minutes) when the volume (on/off) button broke. Thankfully I still had the packaging but I had to pull it out of the trash can to return this thing. Think I'm going to try to find a different shower radio."
1,Huh?,"I was expecting a great punk album, but instead it sounded like the Goo Goo Dolls. F2F has sold out to reach a wider audience (and sell more records).."
1,Not sure.,"I don't know if I'm qualified to judge this product. All I know is it did not work the way for me I thought it would. I had been told that as you age, you stop producing HCl for digestion. I thought if I took this product it would help with stomach health. It didn't. I actually had more stomach distress. I'm not sure if it was caused by the product. It just didn't work for me."
1,4 Seasons 38646 Orifice Tube,"This item does not fit the 2001 Chevy Prizm, but the description says it does. I hope that Amazon and 4 Seasons will change its description to better serve the buying public."
1,nice try,I have been a fan of Face To Face for about eight years. I've liked pretty much every album they have released and I won't say I dislike this one even though it is by far the worst they have. Most likely they wanted to grow as a band and stop playing tired old punk rock but what they should realize is that's what there good at. Some songs on this album are good but some ar so cheesy it's hard to listen to they sound like really bad Bush songs. I give the guys credit for the effort but fellas don't try this again stick with what your good at.
1,"Laborious, at best","A tiring read with content nuggets few and far between, this book is tough to get through. Endless dialogue between the players in yet another ineffective novel format, you'll be skipping pages looking for ideas you can actually put to use. With excellent books already on the market covering the concept of ACCOUNTABILITY this book by Lebow/Spitzer is superfluous. I recommend John G. Miller's writings: ""QBQ! The Question Behind the Question"" and his first book ""Personal Accountability."" These are content rich, loaded with terrific stories, and practical. Plus, having just seen Miller keynote a meeting for us, he truly understands personal accountabilty and its application at work and at home. Excellent speaker!"
1,Bonus Tracks Can't Save This Album,The bonus tracks can't help what turned out to be the worst album of 1999. It's a shame that this has happened to such a great band.
1,Didn't work for me,"The mechanism that pulls up the stopper in the tank doesn't have enough range to open the flap completely without holding the handle down. IE - The handle moves only slightly when you push down on it.I tried working with it for over an hour, but the design was too limited to replace my original equipment. Had to return it. I found another brand (fluidmaster 686) that worked for me. The handle was plastic with a metal lever, and it worked - had the range to actually lift the flapper off the drain and flush completely without holding down the handle."
2,Highly recommend a replacement plan,"This is an excellent toy, however, the touch-screen durability leaves a lot to be desired. There have been 4 Leapsters in my house in the past 18 months.I purchased the first for my 4-year-old. That one crapped out less than a month after purchase, so I took it back to the store. The second was covered by a replacement plan. After the second one died, I called the replacement-plan administators who instructed me to send the game to them. Three weeks later, I had a check for the replacement.I finally replaced that one and to top it off, I also had to purchase another for my 2-year-old. In total, my house has seen 4 leapsters.I strongly encourage one to purchase the replacement plan. $15 extra in the beginning saved me $140 on game consoles and over $200 worth of games that would have been rendered useless. Imagine those numbers now times 2.This is no exaggeration."
2,LOVE IT LOVE IT LOVE IT!,"Short and simply, this is a must buy toy. Very educational and FUN. Hours will be spend playing and learning. This product is worth every penny.The product itself is very well built. Batteries last a long time. The cartridges are filled with activities to do. It is very portable.I thought the leap pad was great, but this is much more wonderful."
2,My Daughter Loves It,Great for travel or to play around the house. The games are educational and my daughter does not get bored of it. She had it when she was three and she is four now.
2,leapster,Love it. All three of my kids have one. I can't believe how much they have learned. Video games like these I don't mind the kids playing.
2,No Stopping My 4 year old!,"We gave this to our little boy on his 4th birthday. He loves it, is learning tons, and it keeps him quiet in the car. He is also very rough with his toys and it is holding up perfectly. Great purchase."
2,Great learning game!,Game gives child the feeling of having his own very functional video game and they learn fast while using it. To be honest I enjoy playing with it also.
2,Leapster FAILS!,"Why the Leapster was fun for my kids when we first got it, we have had to return two Leapster because the screen will not calibrate. This has only been in a two month period. If I have to return to get a new one every month it is not worth it. I am curious to hear if the Pixster is having the same problems."
2,"brain-food, this is good even for the solitary","An outlay of many different types of well-built ritual and ceremony; I don't get the empty feeling of ""but something's missing here"" that i do when reading buckland or cunningham or starhawk; some of these (especially ""Das Tierdrama"")could be put to use no matter what your religion (even if you're an atheist), and of course the Satanic Baptisms can made to fit any religion that utilizes magik and/or the four elements. There is something powerful and moving to these rituals (even just READING them), and they seem to have more than just one or two layers to them. I believe it's the best book of rituals I've ever seen."
2,A Truly Delightful Read,"What a delight to read. There was so much emotion and strength in this book that it has been a treasured (and much read) addition to my library. It is one book that has appeal to both non-Trekers and Trekers alike. The message is so universal. The inspiration held within these pages is incredible. Much like the messages within Consillium and other works of Mr. Nimoy's, it is a guide to overcoming many of the the innumerable tests in life. A must read! Very uplifting!"
2,Leonard Nimoy is a TRUE POET not just an actor.,"His poems are truly worth reading and rereading. He is truly a classic poet in my mind along Keats, Shelley. Time will tell but Leonard Nimoy is a truly gifted person."
2,Excellent book from the 1950's,"A unique enjoyable reference book that covers fads and unproven or controversial scientific notions. Surprisingly, there are some topics mentioned in the book that seemed farfetched science or theory to this mid 20th century author that may be on the way to provable fact from the efforts of contemporary 21st century scholars and scientists."
2,Pictorial Rich,"Very good pictorial of Kuwait: representing its culture,geography, and modern architecture. Would have liked to seen morepost-war pictures of its infastructure following the war, but good visual book nonetheless."
2,no speakerphone option,This phone set works great - my only complaint is that there is no speakerphone option on the handsets.
2,Hello!,I have been a fan of Motorola for years. I liked the look of this and the price was right on for what you get. My only complaint is the address book only holds 10 phone numbers. The hand set holds another 10 so you've got 20 total if you can remember which phone has which numbers. Other than that it performs well with the other features. The ring is somewhat annoying but it does get your attention. Luckily I have a cell phone(Motorola) with all the numbers I need.
2,Your own voice is loud in your ear,"These phones work well in all aspects except that when you speak into the handset, your own voice seems to be amplified into the speaker at your ear. I find myself having to change the position of the phone away from my ear in order to not blow my ears out!Also, no headphones jack."
2,Great to entertain,"I bought this for my daughter, who at the time was 4-1/2. She liked it but required help with learning how to move. As she got older & used to it she enjoyed it quite a bit, she even still pulls it out on occasion. The only down side was with the system itself as it requires a VERY WELL LIT room to function properly."
2,Perfect - Seems almost Current,"Although this was written some time ago - in the 50's I think - it is more apropos even today. When one considers all the pseudo-science, fads, and utter ridiculous irrationality that has crept into ""mainstream"" thought, a book like this ia like a good stiff drink to refresh the senses.I have long been looking for a common denominator of wacky thinking and maybe Gardner has given the most plausible one - it goes against demonstrable science and is totally irrational. The Einstein was Wrong chapter was a hoot. I still smile thinking of guys trying to disprove Einstein with phrases like ""he done gone and tried to make us believe all that stuff"".The wacky belief systems are also dissected but one has to keep in mind that this is BEFORE the age of the Hollywood medium, the channeling of the ignorant or the use of ouija boards (Reagan) or crystal balls (Hillary) at the White House. A great book to read and reread."
2,Great Case!,I love these cases and own two of them. I have had problems with other cd cases in the past because they damaged my cds and this one is what I have been looking for. It is nice and sturdy and couldn't be more happy with it. I only wish they were still made so I could buy more.
2,An excellent component of Poul Anderson's Technic Civilization series,"""People of the Wind"" is an interesting story about the Planet Avalon, which has been jointly and amicably settled by Earthmen and Ythrians. Ythrians are an avian race, quite capable of flight. One of Poul Anderson's strengths as a writer was his ability to create imaginative non-human races and extrapolate and attribute a non-human psychology to them. The Ythrians are an unusually imaginative example of this, and the interaction between humans and Ythrians makes for a very interesting tale.This story is part of Poul Anderson's Technic Civilization future history series, which features some of Anderson's best writing. This story is set during the rise of the Terran Empire after the fall of the free-market Polesotechnic League. The rise of the Empire and its encroachment upon Avalon is the theme of the story, and it is excellent entertainment; typical of this series. Highly recommended for lovers of ""hard"" science fiction. RJB."
2,Very Good Mystery,"Respectfully, I wish to disagree with Harriet Klausner. This is not a cozy mystery. It is a thoughtful mystery by a thoughtful writer who is the Anne Perry of the contemporary eastern old money establishment, a chronicler of the mores and social rules that bind this elite community of the privileged. It is well written and well plotted. It is sedate, which is a perfect match for the environment in which the murder and its resolution occur."
2,Great King Triton Wig for Little Mermaid !,This is the only wig that came close to what I was looking at for Great King Triton in Little Mermaid.
2,Toy Review,Darkseid is a really cool superman villain and lots of fun to play with. However whats in the picture isnt really what you get. The actual color is black instead of blue. He also comes with sum gear which i think is kind of annoying. still its pretty cool and fun to lay with 4 outta 5.
2,Civ IV to the enth degree,"Better graphics, bigger action, and great generals and leaders and cool special buildings for your Civ!"
2,A Civ addict's fix,"An interesting update to CivIV. The biggest change is not the addition of ""great military leaders"" but the reduction in the impact of many civ-specific units."
2,creative for lunchbag,"My kids are very tired of the same lunchbags everyday, so this was a Godsend. They loved the variety and I loved not having to think every day what to put in their lunchbags! The recipies are very easy and fun to make. My kids love to prepare them with me. We go to the supermarket together and prepare some in anticipation. The color pictures help a lot, because you know what they are supposed to look like and they make it easier for my kids, so they can prepare them for themselves. The information is accurate and easy. I only wish it had more!!!"
2,Even If You Have All His Albums...,"There is the beautiful book cover in purple, there are the lyrics printed in verse format...but mostly , there are the scrawling, handwritten notations of a [pick your adjective]madman/poet/devout/philosopher/philanderer.And the drawings Nick Cave makes...oh my, he seems to be at war with himself and that is Really interesting. You will enjoy seeing different lyric versions, and his writing in progress as things get crossed out and then re-written. This book is definitely a must have for the Nick Cave devotee."
2,great for special ed and general ed students,the book was very helpful with my special ed. students and with the general ed. class. great for modifications with special ed. students.
2,A classic.,"I bought this book to give to a friend, in the hopes that it will help her as much as it has helped me, over the years."
2,A wonderful escape.,"Luchbreaks, train journeys, bus rides spent with tribes, gorrillas, armies and cats. What a colourfully bizarre imagination you have Mr de Bernieres."
2,practical and straightforward,"An amazing book! If anyone wants the real deal on Islam, and doesn't have time to wade through all the mumbo jumbo and politics that many books confuse Islam with, then this is the book you need to read. It's a simple read, and it's loaded with all the basics that you need in a metaphorical, yet practical and straighforward way."
2,Fun and Entertaining for toddler to teen,"I LOVED this game when I was a teen, I would spend countless hours ""breeding"" and ""showing"" these Dogz and now my 4yo (who is very active and rarely sits still and quiet for long)will spend up to 2hrs playing with, ""dressing"", and ""painting"" her Petz. It's also great because it helps her with fine motor skills. Sure the graphics aren't as good as some of the new games(and there not bad considering how old this game is) but you can do so much more with this one which is ideal for keeping older kids entertained."
2,Fun for all ages!,"It's a real fun game for my 12 year old and my 4 year old. They can have as many virtual pets as they want and they love choosing between cats and dogs. Several months after first playing it they're still finding new surprises and enjoying watching their pets learn and change. Every once in a while the game crashes though... I've yet to discover why, though. It never happens when I'm watching and the kids can't seem to tell me what they were doing with the game at the time it crashes so trouble-shooting it has been tricky where that's concerned. Could be a game glitch, could be something my kids are doing (too many pets moving around at once or something?). But in all this game's worth the price. Loads of fun."
2,Great but....,"I think Petz is great, but there is One problemo. My dad has PC, ok big woop. But I can only use PEtz on a PC! Since my parnets are divorced they live sperately, meaning that my mom has a macintosh computer! I live with my mom most of the time, so I dont get to play PEtz for most of the week. So i say, that Petz, as well as, Dogz, Catz, and Babyz be compatible with macintosh computers."
2,Pretty Good,"This game is so fun. You learn many lessons on how to rise pets. The babies are so CUTE!!!! There is just one problem. After two or three weeks, it stops working! Mabey this is just my computer, but be careful!"
2,Best Game in the world!,"I am 12 years old(Going on 13) And I LOVE this game. It teaches responsibilty and you have fuun at the same time. ITS ADDICTING! The game is fun, but the really fun partt is going on-line and dowloading clothes, toys, breedz and other cool stuff! My 4 year old brother even likes this game! Its really fun if you get both (catz and dogz) and see them interact. I like it a lot better than petz 4! Hope you buy this product-addicted to Petz 5"
2,Keeps them happy!,"The Catz Game has been a favorite for children in our family for years. Now with the Dogz added, what could be better?"
2,simple but fun,"Basically, you raise and care for virtual pet dogs or cats. Both of my daughters, ages 3.5 and 9, love this game. The 9 year old understands it better and is able to play it the way it is intended to be played, but the 3.5 year old still likes to get on the computer and play with the cute little dogs. It is a simplistic game, but the animals are cute. Nothing challenging here- you feed, exercise, and groom your virtual dogs/cats on a daily basis. If you don't regularly care for them, they run away. They can fall in love and have puppies/kittens. Again, nothing challenging, but both of my daughters enjoy this game a lot."
2,my review,"I was thinking a while ago about this game that I played when I was younger. I really liked it then, and wish that I had owned it. So I went online to see if they still made it, AND THEY DID!! I bought it immediently, and when I got it last month I haven't stopped playing it!! It is a good game, and its good for kids because it teaches them how to take care of pets. Anf not to mention, they are so damn cute!"
2,Good but was expecting more from TKC!,"I won't be all negative about it since this set DOES have some good beats although I was expecting a lot better from TKC. With over 100 trackz you would think you can't go wrong but to me, 70% of it was stuff I've already heard and the mixin' of it wasn't exactly giving it a ""new face""...just same ol' stuff. It all depends on what u like, what your style is, etc. Get it as it does have some good stuff but it's not an absolute best as you would expect from TKC as seen on his other CDs but then again, they weren't from the ""Mixing It Up"" series. I've heard A LOT of peoplez telling me this CD (both of 'em!) is of da hook but I was expecting more. Get it and check it yourself...I'm sure you'll like [at least half of] it! ;)"
2,Explodes a couple of myths,"My great uncle was an air gunner in 141 Squadron and his picture is in the book, so this was a must have. despite the family connection, there was plenty still to learn and Alec Brew skillfully explodes some myths, one of them being that the German pilots did not know what the Defiant was until after Dunkirk. He also goes into detail on other Turret Fighters and the real reason becomes plain why the design failed."
2,I'm in love,"I love this book! If you have an interest in military history- on the subject of aircraft, this is one great book. Expensive, but worth it."
2,"I'm getting OLD - Okay, now move on!","Excellent book! Gail breaks down the stages of this adult hood. Some of the things we complain our parents never told us about? Gail explains much of it, including the subtle internal changes adults feel, and wonder if they should disappear from society and become a recluse.The book presents explanations of the changes we experience as an adult and using common sense language."
2,A Must Read,This book is in the top five of my favorites. It helped me understand different stages of life and what to expect as we age and mature. I read it for the first time in my 30's and now in my 50's I'm reading it again and still picking up new nuggets of valuable information. This book should be mandatory reading for every woman.
2,"Leapster, excellent alternative to Game Boy","My 5 year old has been begging for a Game Boy, but I am reluctant because I would like to see him use his free time for something more educational...so I bought the Leapster and WE LOVE IT!!! It fullfills his need for a handheld game while at the same time meeting all my ""educational"" requirements. He is able to use it without help (after a month or so of practice), and his 3 year old sister can even manage some of the more simpler games. We bought Dora's Wildlife Rescue, as well as Spiderman, and Kindergarten. The only one I wouldn't recoomend is The letter Factory, and ONLY if like me you already own the DVD and the Leapster game will then be boring. This is a must have for kids going into, or already in kindergarten. My only complaint, if you can call it that, is that the screen tends to get scratched the more we use it. Still, even knowing that in a year or so we might need a new one, I WOULD STILL make purchase!"
2,Greatest toy ever,"this toy has been in our house for over a year. My now 5 year old daughter still picks it as her favorite toy. Anytime a long car ride is in order, the leapster comes with us. It is the greatest learning tool, the kids do not even realize they are learning. I recommend getting the rechargable battery with the charger base to go with it"
2,My four-year-old is in love,I bought this for my four-year-old son for his birthday. He absolutely adores the system. His teenaged cousins love it too. I view it one of my best investments in my child's entertainment because it is educational and fun as well.
2,MUST HAVE!!!,"I bought this as a Christmas present when my son was 4 yrs. old -- he's 5 now. He absolutely loves it and has quickly learned how to navigate everything on his own, which isn't really surprising as he's very tech savvy. The games are extremely educational (I tested it out myself!), but fun at the same time so there is NO way kids would get bored playing it. He's got every game except for the ones designed for girls. He's still in kindergarten, but he often plays with the cartridges at the 1st grade level. I definitely would recommend this toy to all parents. Most parents complain about the price, but I still think it's worth buying because it teaches kids so much. But still, it's a shame it's practically half the price I paid for it because it is so affordable now and it even comes in new colors."
2,LEAPSTER IS IN A LEAGUE OF ITS OWN!,"I BOUGHT THE LEAPSTER THIS YEAR, AND MY 6 YR. OLD LOVES THIS! SHE GOT THE PIXTER LAST YEAR, AND LOVED IT ALSO, BUT IT CANNOT TOUCH THE LEAPSTER. SHE EVEN WANTED TO TAKE IT TO THE MOVIES (GO FIGURE?)I BOUGHT HER JUST ABOUT ALL OF THE CARTRIDGES, THAT WERE FOR GIRLS, AND SHE CANNOT PUT IT DOWN LONG ENOUGH TO SWITCH GAMES. SPONGEBOB SEEMS TO BE HER FAVORITE SO FAR, MAYBE SHE WILL OPEN UP THE OTHER NINE SOMEDAY.THE SCREEN IS MAGNIFICENT, AND IT IS LARGE ENOUGH TO SEE WITHOUT STRAINING YOUR EYES. THIS IS A MUST HAVE FOR THE EASILY DISTRACTED CHILD, WILL KEEP THEM OCCUPIED FOR HOURS! SERIOUSLY, MY DAUGHTER PUTS IT DOWN TO EAT AND POTTY."
2,peace and quiet,"I bought 3 Leapsters for my 5 year old daughter and 3 year old boy/girl twins. I knew it would be a hit with the 5 year old, but I cannot believe how much the younger kids love it too. They literally play for an hour at a time with them. We took them in the car with us and didn't hear a peep out of any of them. A definite must have for parents of preschoolers!"
2,"""This is really cool""",My 5 yr. old son's words to his friend were come and check this cool thing I got with the excitement usually reserved for a Power Ranger Toy ! He plays with this every morning instead of tv now! What we were impressed with was the hint factor when a game is too hard and also the way the product adjusts to the player's skill. The drawing cartridge is helpful in practicing his writing skills and the games have helped him with his number recognition and his confidence has soared because he realizes he now knows his letters and numbers!This is a fantastic toy which we would recommend to everyone.
2,This will actually keep them interested.,"This was bought by grandpa for my son's 4th birthday. He loves this. He has had it for 1 week and I can not get over what he has learned so far. He'll say ""Mom, I am working on my shapes"" or ""I am working on opposites"". Before this, I would try and sit and work with him on these things and he didn't care. Now he is telling me all about them. The Leapster is absolutely amazing. What a wonderful idea!!! This is the by far the best learning system that keeps the interest of the little ones."
2,Great for Traveling,We bought each of our children a Leapster for our 33-hour car ride. They entertained them most of the way and the children were learning as well. It was great because the Leapsters can even be played at night. Buy some headphones and you cut down on the noise. Each Leapster used 4-AA batteries which lasted at least 20 hours of continuous play.
2,Take good care of your leapsters stylus!,"Both my kids have the Leapster and I have been very pleased up until now. A sylus pen has snapped in half and I am finding it impossible to get a replacement. So take good care of your stylus!You would think you could buy a replacement but I have contacted the manufacture and they are discontinued. New pens are on backorder and to get one I have to just keep calling back every once in a while! Ok I have nothing better to do! I guess I should throw out the game and just buy a new one!If your Leapster breaks take the pen off and sell it on ebay, it should sell fast as the only one on the planet for sale."
2,Hope this one lasts,We got this for our four year old for her birthday. It was a big hit with all ages. Seemed very durable. After about a month we put it a way for awhile and when we got it back out it the pen didn't work. Tried to re-callibrate and had no luck. Luckily we bought it at [store] and had no trouble returning it. All I can say is I hope this one lasts. We have bought the case and three games. The kids love it but I will be taking it back again if it acts up. For the money it should last many years.
2,First review,It turned out smaller than I had thought from the pictures. It is supposed to include ALL the software you would need but it seems limited and you would requie to purchase many more single games. Overall an interesting toy. Easy for the kids to get a hang of its use.
2,well worth the money,"here is a learning tool that we were weary about spending the money on. it has turned out to be one of the best purchases for our 5 year old as of yet. he has not put it down. it is more or less like a palm pilot in color, except plays educational games and uses critical thinking skills. we have the dora and kindergarten cartridges, and my son loves both of them. he is learning sequence, math, having patience to listen to directions, and so much more.a wonderful, wonderful product that i can not say enough about."
2,Great Educational Toy,"Of course this is still a ""video game"", so you don't want your kid to be playing it all day, but I love that my boys want to play it and that they are learning AS they play. These games are very durable. I have all boys and they are HARD on their toys. I bought this for my 4th child since his older brothers already have their own. They have lasted years now. I am very happy with my purchase."
2,LEAPSTER- Run don't Walk....,"This toy is absolutely incredible, I tested it and played with it for almost an hour myself. It is extremely educational and very fun for my 5 year old daughter. She hasn't put it down! The screen is huge, in color and very clear, the sound is very clear and all you do is take it out of the box and it tells your child exactly what to do...it's that simple. There are many different levels and the Leapster assess' your childs ability as they play. This is the answer to the parents prayers of those horrible violent video games...and they are learning to!"
2,Its actually educational!,"My 4 year old daughter has ALOT of toys, the video now, a fake camera, a few computer games but she was having a tough time learning.I thought I would try a Pixter, until I saw the Leapster! Its very easy to use and actually an electronic toy thats educational. We own dora, spongebob, barbie, and every cartridge under the sun! She now counts, spells, and even adds! Shes learning well with the leapster, and I doubt she even knows it. I am so happy I bought this ""gadget"" for her. Its easy to use, doesnt kill bateries (Although we have a re-charger since that Video Now goes through them like theres no tommorow!). Its pretty durable (my 10 month old sons have gotten a hold of it and havent broken it yet!) It shouldnt be dropped or anything, but its held up to slight abuse...I usually dont enjoy purchasing weird electronics for my children, but this leapster was a neccesity... GREAT FOR LEARNING!"
2,Great learning toy!,"I just bought this for my son for his 4th birthday, and he absolutely loves it!!! He has been playing some of my games on my iPhone, and I thought that he might like something of his own (and I would like him playing some more age-appropriate, learning games!). The game that is built in to it, the Frogger type game, took him a few tries to really get the hang of, but now he looks at me with an incredibly proud look on his face every time he makes it to the other side! We also got the Wall-E game to go along with it, and he loves that as well.This was easily his favorite birthday present, and I think it will be a companion for many years to come! (And he still loves to read......this didn't distract him from any of the other things that he likes to do, as I had feared it might!)This is a must have for entertaining, and teaching kids. The size of it is just right for his hands, as well. Love it!"
2,love it,"I have two boys, 4 and 7. They both play with their leapsters. Their favorite games are Spongebob and Batman. We have the older one and it is just fine, plus they both like the built in games. Has been durable too - tossed about in the van a bit."
2,Pleasant Surprise!!!,"I purchased this for my 5 year old granddaughter who's very into Game Boy Advanced, PS2, ect. and was doubtful that she would give this a chance but she did and she chooses it first now!!! She enjoys the Sponge Bob cartridge as well as the drawing cartridge and spends hours sitting with it. I really believe that the voiced instructions let her feel truely independent not like the GBA where she hasn't yet been able to read the instructions. I highly recommend this and hope that they continue to make new cartridges for this to keep it new!"
2,"Was fun, but doesn't last long...","I bought this product for my daughter for Christmas. For my son I bought a game boy advance. After about three weeks of use of the Leapster I had to return the product because of some calibration problems. The replacement only lasted about two weeks as well, and I am currently trying to get a replacement for that since these products are warrantied for a year through Leap Frog, and I think that's the only good part about the 80.00 you spend on it. As far as the disappointment, my children really enjoyed the Leapster system. Maybe Leap Frog will be improving it now... (...)"
2,leapster review,"The leapster is a hand held learning game system with cartridges that can expand the system. It is good for the under 10 age group. The one disadvantage is there are many non-educational games that can also be played on the system and kids get credits to play these games. The credits are very easy to earn, so theoretically, they can use it like a game boy only."
2,problems dont always last,"We received the leapster for our daughter birthday. Within a few months the recalibrated did not work (directions in opackage were wrong) and the touch screen did not work. I called LEAPFROG... THey sent me another one. I sent them the old on back. A few months latter it happened AGAIN. AS a result, they sent me another one. This time, everything was OK. My daughter loved this toy so much I did not want to give it up. But thank GOD for Leapfrog. It seems as though they honor there stuff."
2,On Becoming Teenwise,"This is a helpful book for parents who are having serious problems with their teenaged child. I was looking for a book on the more basic teen behaviors, such as talking back etc, and this book does not really get into the more basic issues."
2,Love Stinks,"The video was really cute and had some of my favorite Hey Arnold! episodes, but the quality of the tape was poor. It was in 6 hour mode so it wasn't as clear as on normal TV, but it was still good. The only other disappointment was that the episodes are restricted to only 1st and the beginning of 2nd season, so there was no Lila (not that that's necessarily a bad thing :) Luckily though, the Valentine episode is from 1st season so it's on there along with some other favorites. All in all, it's definitely worth the money."
2,Handy Training Guide,"This book provides valuable info and tools to train ANY dog! The descriptions and given situations, (not to mention some well placed humor!) prepare you for what could, (and does!) happen when living with our Canine friends!"
2,"The A-Z of living with Wolfdogs, a great guide","A great book, very informative it remains on our table as a go to resource for raising our Wolfdog puppy. I highly recommend this book by Nicole Wilde!"
2,Whether you own or just want the truth about wolfdogs - this is it!,"I loved Nicole Wilde's book! It is very apparent that she is not only very experience but very knowledgeable in working with wolfdogs and her techniques applies to dogs as well. I especially appreciate the positive and down-to-earth approach she takes in tackling everyday situations sometimes associated with owning wolfdogs. In addition, she has a whole section dedicated to nutrition - whether you have a dog or cat! With the recent discoveries of poison in some dog and cat foods, she provides a crucial alternative to feeding packaged foods!"
2,"Brief, but valuable volume on this founding father","John Witherspoon was a unique blend of educator, clergyman, and founding father. There are not many good books on this neglected founding father, and this one is by no means exhaustive, but it does give a good, balanced overview of his role as the president of Princeton College and the only clergyman to sign the Declaration of Independence, among other significant contributions to the founding of the United States of America. The list of his students at Princeton that went on to serve in government roles is staggering by itself, and secures his place in American History.This book merely whets your appetite to know more about Witherspoon, but unfortunately, there are not many other sources to go deeper, so I recommend this great volume about a neglected founder that deserves more attention."
2,Sanus System VM200S TV Wall Mount,"Great product at a great price. Best Buy offered the same product at double the price. It was easy to install, and is a solid product. Also allows just enough room for cabling connect/disconnects. I love it!"
2,Easy to Intall,"Had no trouble installing this wall mount for my 32"" LCD as the instructions were very good. I also saved a lot of money off of what Best Buy wanted for the same mount. Highly recommend getting a tilting mount to help reduce glare which is what this one is. Hardest part is finding the center of 2 studs which is easy if you have a good stud finder and use mini finishing nails to verify the edges of your studs. Great product."
2,Essentail book for Latin American military history,Scheina does an excellent job with the second installment of Latin America;s Wars. This time he focuses on the nations of Latin America and their professional armies. He includes the conflicts in both world wars as well as the various interwar rebellions fought. The book also includes the fight over the Falkland Islands. The Mexican revolution takes up a few chapters of the book but it is a very good analysis. Like his other book this one is really much more of a reference guide to Latin American wars and is a great companion to textbooks. It is a must have for any library on Latin American History.
2,Excellent,This book has TONS of useful information from birth to death. Really is a resource to save!!
2,A value recording with a drawback,"A great recording and inexpesnive. The only drawback is that it lacks the ""frill"" of a libretto. So if you want to understand what is being sung in Egyptian, you're out of luck."
2,Great book!!!,"Ok let's get started. Five stars for Wolves in the Walls by Neil Gaiman Because after I read this book I was laughing my head off! This book starts out when Lucy hears thumping and crunching while she is sleeping and agrees to herself that there are wolves in the walls and goes to tell her mom, dad and her little brother but they think she's being silly. But unfortunately Lucy's right. Read this book!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!By: Jake"
2,I'm 26 and I bought this for myself...and I'm not ashamed!,"I love Neil Gaiman and I love Dave Mckean, back from the first edition of Coraline. I bought the book for myself and I'm not ashamed. I love children's literature and I love Neil Gaiman's writing & Mckean's artwork. There is such a Tim Burton-ish, Roald Dahl-esque quality which occurs when these two team up; it's a haunting beauty. I think the story is fabulous, not too scary for young kids, & the art is breathtaking. Beautiful elaborate drawings.A+"
2,Does Your Kid Have a Wry Sense of Humor?,"If so, this book is for them! About half the kids we've seen love (just LOVE!) this book; the others just don't get it.There is great, kid-friendly off-beat artwork and a bit of a wacky sense of humor in the tradition of ""Where the Wild Things Are"". Much of the humor is at the expense of sweet but somewhat clueless parents who first deny the existence of childhood horrors but then permit themselves to be dispossessed of their house when the horrors come out. But, when a brave child faces her horrors all becomes right with the world. Until...Highly recommended."
2,Leapster Review,"I purchased this for my 5 yr old daughter and she really loved it but it caused an issue between her and my 3 year old son. I didn't think a 3 yr old would be able to play with this, but he loves it as well and I should have purchased one for him to avoid the throwdown.Great toy and they will sit (mainly in the car) for quite a while playing with it, especially the part where they color in the scenes and add the moving characters like ghosts, shooting stars, etc. I was worried that my son would destroy this like all other toys, but so far it has held up to some pretty impressive drops."
2,great fun and educational even for some children under 4...,"This is the second Leapster in our home. We bought the pink one for our daughter last Christmas. She was 2.5 yrs at the time. While it was perhaps just a bit advanced, not too much, for our little girl, she still enjoyed. At that age she particularly enjoyed the simple built-in drawing program. On year later she has a few cartridges and enjoys figuring out the different games. This green Leapster was for our son who is only two and some months. Again the Leapster is a little to advanced for a child this age. However I've noticed that our boy also likes the drawing program. The Diego cartridge is definitely too complex for our boy, but we know he'll eventually figure it out. For now he's sharing it with his older sister."
2,Very good for beginners,The book is very easy to understand and it is good for beginners. It explains all the basics of the program.
2,Don't be rough on it...,"We purchased this toy for our son last Christmas, and it was the #1 hit in our house. Both my son (6.5 yrs) and my daughter (4.5 yrs.) loved it. We took it on vacation this April, and a heavy-handed friend of my son's played with it, ruining the screen (he pressed the stylus on the monitor too hard). The screen now has black lines down it and you can't see well anymore. I tried to contact the company via email to see if we could get the screen replaced, and they NEVER REPLIED.So, I'd have to lean toward the ""buyer beware"" camp of these ratings. My son is very dissappointed.Good luck..."
2,leapster,We have a 4 year old that just loves the leapster. We are very pleased with it as well. One complaint-One of the choices that comes loaded into the game is a series of ads for other cartridges. I feel this is inappropriate. I can see including a leaflet or booklet in the product packaging but to actually load this into the game is not right.
2,GREAT TOY,"I bought the Leapster two years ago for my then 4 yr old...when it first came out. It has really been a great toy. My daughter loves it. When my younger child started playing with it, we bought him one, too. They still play it frequently....especially on trips in the car. They will be getting more cartridges this Christmas. I highly recommend this toy for it's educational and entertainment value.The Leapster does go through a lot of batteries - - though I certainly don't have to change them as often as some of the other reviews have suggested. I know there is a recharging station you can purchase, which might solve the proble...though I haven't found it necessary get one. Overall this has been a great buy for my family. You won't regret giving this to your child for Christmas! I hope they continue to come out with more cartridges! Way to go Leapfrog!"
2,has my vote,I manage an afterschool program for k-8. The kids love playing the game and I love the leapster since all the games are educational. I also love the fact that the games work with all the styles of leapster.
2,"Amazing, cheap, educational video games for the young ones",I bought this off a personal reference of how great it was. Well i wasn't disappointed. The only thing i was disappointed about was they release a 2nd version about a month after my purchase. The nice thing about this one is that the new games are backwards compatable and the pen/stylus is attached so you can't loose it. My son played this for hours and hours when we got it in the mail. He still plays it on a regular basis (it lost some of its cool value) but it is still a very entertaining/educational game system. You can get just about any disney/pixar character you want in a game.
2,Not so durable,"We purchased the Leapster for our daughter last Christmas and she likes it (although she says she would rather have a DS). However, last month she was sitting on a step stool (very low to the ground) and the Leapster slipped out of her hands and fell to the tile floor. The leapster has not worked since and I have tried everything. This is a children's toy and should be able to withstand a fall to the floor without permanent damage. We were very disappointed and could not even blame our daughter. It was just an accident. That having been said, we are shelling out for a new one this Christmas, but be warned and do not drop it."
2,Great Choice!!,"I had purchased the leap pad for my daughter and she barely looked at it. I was scared to spend the money on this thinking the same thing would happen, but it didn't. As soon as we opened it and put the batteries in she was using it. It was very easy for her to navigate and she is 5 years old. We have the Dora and Drawing cartridges. She takes it in the car and we take it to resturants to entertain her while we wait for our food. If your thinking about it BUY it... It is worth it. The initial batteries lasted a long time too."
2,Leapster,"this is a great system, my grandson loves it and it is durable enough for ""the moose"" otherwise known as Alex!!"
2,What a great toy for kids all the way upto age 8 or more,"I just bought Leapster for my 6 year old for Christmas. I was a little hesitant because Amazon's recommended age was upto 6, eventhough the manufacturer's age was upto 8. There are plenty of cool educational games and activities in the Leapster to keep her entertained and challenged for quite a while yet. And the back of the box said they will be releasing software soon for second graders. I cannot even begin to tell you how smooth the animation and graphics are on this toy. Also If a player cannot accomplish the game at the level they are trying, it stops and gives a quick tutorial to help them and then encourages them to try again. If they still can't get it, the game knows to get easier. It's absolutely amazing. I'm glad I spent the money on it and I know she's going to love it."
2,Great Item!,My son loves his leapster. There are a great deal of games that he is able to play that are fun and educational. And it works great on airplanes.
2,Great toy!!!,"I am a grandmother of a 4 year old boy and he loves this toy. It is educational, easy to use, and I love to play it too. It is one of the few electronic toys that does not make him hyper and he will study the tasks and play for long periods of time. It is the best toy he got for Christmas I think and he does too!!"
2,Great choice,"I bought this toy for my 4 1/2 year old son. His 7 year old brother has a gameboy his grandma gave him last year, and I thought that this would be a better choice. I was so right! The older boy got 2 new games for his gameboy, but hardly touched them because he was playing with the Leapster. I look forward to the recharger coming since we are already on our second set of batteries (which is why I gave it a 4 for durability.) I am glad they both like it because for $80 + extra cartridges, you don't want a one use toy. And I don't have to feel guilty letting them play!"
2,Screen not the best quality,"My 3 year old loves her leapster, but like everyone else we are on the 3rd one in a year. Her's is not mistreated but we have have a multitude of problems each time. My number one complaint is that the screen could be a little clearer. Other than that she loves it!! Leapfrog will replace them when they tear up."
2,Excellent educational toy!,"Well, I just got this for my 4.5 year old son for Christmas, after a long anticipated wait. I am very impressed! The screen is bigger than I thought it would be. I stayed up all night playing the games! We purchased the Kg., Dora, and Spongebob cartridges and can't wait to purchase the Drawing and Alphabet cartridges when they become available. There is also a Pre-Kg. cartridge becoming available soon. There is a charging dock that will be available soon as well as a carrying case that will hold the Leapster and 6 cartridges. After falling in love with the concept of the LeapPad Books, I have focused most of our son's presents and friend's presents on LeapFrog products. This product is more than worth the money. I was just about to consider another handheld video game for Christmas and then I found out that LeapFrog was releasing the Leapster. I, of course, knew it would be of great quality and am highly impressed with the games and their educational quality."
2,Great alternative to Gameboy!,"My kids love this, and they are from 7-12. Lots of games to buy with it. It is foremost a learning tool and then they get rewarded when they do well by letting them play a few mindless games (like arcade) in between. Highly recommended."
2,Great starting at age 3!,"We bought this a couple of years ago when our son was 3. It was a bit advanced at the time, but he loved trying to play it anyway. As he has grown, it has stayed a favorite in our house. The original games we bought have become educational at different levels and there are always new games. We only own 4 games and he is never bored with it. I think it is a great gift for boy or girl ages 3-6 and feel it is something they will use for years.I do recommend getting the charging station, as batteries tend to wear out. We bring the charging station on trips so we can charge it before the next car ride.We don't have any other accessories, but it would be nice to have a container that holds the Leapster and the games together.If you have someone under 3, the My First LeapPad was great and we passed it on to our younger child when our first upgraded to the Leapster."
2,Wonderful!,"We bought this for our 4 year old daughter yesterday and we can already tell she is going to love it. I expected that I would have to help her at first but she was so interested in it I was just left to sit and watch her play! She got the knack of playing the games and using the stylus quickly since everything is explained as you play. The games installed on the leapster are great: art studio, memory game, shape sorting, all things she loves to do. We bought extra game cartridges (princess and letter factory)when we bought the Leapster, we thought she might need them. But we have put them aside for later gifts because she seems thrilled with the games it has for now."
2,Love It,"My son was given this on his 4th b-day, he absolutely loves it and so do I! It has taught him alot and the only reason I rated a 4 and not a 5 is because of the battery situation!! Ouch!"
2,We love it!,"I bought this for my son's birthday in November of 2006. I had the choice of getting him the leapster or the leapster l-max.I chose this one because the screen was bigger and it had all the same features, plus, I wanted something portable, I mean we have learning games for the computer, so I wouldn't have to move my husband's gamecube and other systems that he has going on (a plus for that).Fromt he moment he received it, he's been addicted, he calls it his gameboy and he doesn't realize he's learning new stuff while he's using it. I love how he gets soooooo excited when he gets a lil star or a congratulations o something.The Leap Frog toys are great, I'll be a Leap Frog mommy for life!"
2,Great learning device!,"I bought this for my daughter her 5th birthday. She has been playing it almost nonstop. I am delighted to see that she knows so much, she is learing all the basic kindergarten materials while playing video games and listening to stories.The cartidges are great and include most of her favorites tv characters, and of corse the Disney princesses."
2,Believe the hype!,"After having my son completely ignore the LeapPad and PowerTouch systems, I was hesitant to spend my money on the Leapster. Having such good reviews, I decided to give it a go. Finally, a toy that will keep my 4-year old son's attention! By far, this is the most he has EVER played with any toy. We started with the Dora cartridge and the one that comes with the game. Both cartridges have several ""games"", each with three levels. He has easily mastered the first level of each and is working now on the second level. I love the fact that they have designed the cartridges to provide progressive learning experiences. We also bought the Kindergarten cartridge recently and he loves that as well. I would encourage buyers to get some type of carrying case, as the cartridges are rather small and get easily misplaced in a 4-year old's room!"
2,A huge hit at our house!!,"My seven year old and four year old both LOVE the leapster. We have had it for a few months now and, unlike the leap pads they both have, it isn't one of those toys that they get bored of after a few uses. It is still used on a daily basis. Every child that comes over to play (from ages 2 to about 8 yrs) takes instantly to the Leapster. My only complaint is that now I have to buy another one b/c they all want to use it so much! (and sometimes they have to fight mommy to play it to, lol)The pros, it is small and very portable. It doesn't have the books to keep track of, like the leap pads do. It is VERY interactive with various levels on the games to suit kids of various ages. I would recommend buying the carrying case as well though b/c it is an easy place to store the games so they don't get lost. As a mom, the best part is that it is so educational. They are so creative with incorporating math, etc though, that the kids don't even notice they are learning!"
2,THE BEST EDUCATIONAL/FUN ELECTRONIC TOY OUT THERE!,"I JUST BOUGHT THIS TOY FOR CHRISTMAS FOR MY 7YR OLD BOY, AND ALMOST 4 YEAR OLD DAUGHTER. I JUST HAD TO TRY IT OUT FIRST AND COULD NOT BELIEVE HOW MUCH FUN IT REALLY WAS, ALL THE REVIEWS HERE WERE RIGHT ON THE MONEY!THE SCREEN ALONE IS MUCH BIGGER THAN THE GAMEBOY AND THE GRAPHICS AND CHARACTER SOUNDS ARE FANTASTIC! I SHOWED IT TO MY 13 YEAR OLD AND HE EVEN LIKED IT AND PLAYED AROUND WITH IT (MOSTLY BECAUSE HE LIKES SPONGEBOB TOO)HE SAID IT WAS PERFECT FOR HIS LITTLE SISTER AND BROTHER AND HE KNOW'S THEY'LL LOVE IT--ME TOO. I WAS GLAD I BOUGHT THIS OVER THE LEAPFROG WRITING PAD BECAUSE I COULDNT DECIDE WHICH ONE TO GET BECAUSE THEY ARE BOTH GREAT PRODUCTS, BUT THIS ONE CAN DO JUST AS MUCH, I BELIEVE IT HAS A GAME YOU CAN BUY THAT YOUR KIDS CAN ALSO WRITE WITH IT JUST LIKE THE LEAPPAD, AND THE COOLEST PART IS THAT ITS JUST LIKE A VIDEO GAME THAT TEACHES THEIR FIRST STEPS TO READING,MATH,WRITING AND BEYOND.IT'S REALLY WORTH THE MONEY.AND ..."
2,"Finally, A Fun Educational Toy","My three (almost four) year old loves his Leapster. He takes it everywhere. I am loving how well it keeps him entertained in the car and even at restaraunts. I only wish that they made software for the popular characters for each age group. He really wants the Incredibles but it is appropriate for much older children.I was concerned because I had read reviews indicating that the screen was too fragile. My son has dropped it on the sidewalk several times and so far, it has held up beautifully.Also, though he has used it daily for several weeks, we are still on our first set of batteries."
2,"Finally, an educational game that keeps their interest!!!!!!","Finding toys for my son that he will still be interested in the next day is like mission impossible. He is 6 years old and loves to be actively engaged in what he's doing. Cars and trucks just lose his interest. Well, I had a friend then tell me about the Leapster. I decided to give it a chance over the Game Boy, and I'm glad I did. He has not set it down since Christmas morning. The graphics on the screen are amazing. He only got 1 game with it, Dora (all the others were sold out), and he loves it. I love the fact that he's having fun and learning at the same time. Every parent should get this system. It is awesome and you won't regret it. If a boy as picky as mine loves it, trust me, your child will too."
2,Best Gift for fun and learning,"5 yr old grandson, has all types of toys and video games to play, but likes this one best because of the different levels of games to play. Never boring for him as he can ramp up the challenges the leapster offers and its mobility makes it so he can take when he travels. I don't have an opinion on the durability yet. Overall I feel $ well spent."
2,Son loves to learn with Leapster,"This is a great product, why didn't they have things like this when I was a kid??? We already had a pink one for his sister, and my son had been asking for this for over a year, and got one this year. He will sit on his bed playing games with it as long as we will allow it. He loves the cars game and instead of just mindless interaction like the playstation etc. he is actually learning something!"
2,Great educational toy,"The best learning toy I ever bought my son. It is a must for every family with preschool and school age children. Daycares must have this toy! Leapster made his first reading experience enjoyable Just in few weeks my son is capable to read simple lines, this is a great educational toy!It's easy to operate and really lets children play and learn at the same time. I'm so happy to see my kid improving his reading and phonics skills using this well-structured interactive toy and playing with his favorite characters."
2,katie's leapster,"my family loves this product so much that we've had to purchase one for each of our children. It's much more educational than most video games, so I don't mind when my kids play."
2,Sturdy and great!,Two active grandson keep this leapster going! All I do is keep a new battery in them once in awhile!Money well spent!
2,"BLOWS THE PANTS OFF PIXTER, educational too!!",This toy is amazing my daugter loves this toy. She is four and she sits for an hour at a time playing with this toy. The game that comes with it is very educational. FOR MOM WHO'S KIDS WON'T SIT AND LEARN FROM THEM THIS IS THE TOY. Great job leapfrog! I highley recomend this to everyone.
2,#1 Christmas present for 2003!,My 4 year old is the owner of my first leap pad. He likes this game but it doesn't have the excitement of the video games he plays at the store. The Leapster more than satisfies his craving for a video game. He received game boy advanced and leapster and he put down the game boy to go back to the leapster. The screen is a nice size and he can play it in the dark. I really can't say enough about this... it will be passed down to my younger children!
2,A pleased mother,I thought about getting my 5 year old daughter a gameboy advance for Christmas but found this and thought I would see how she liked it. WOW I cant get her away from it!! She plays it all the time. With the Dora cartridge she already knows her colors in spanish!!! With its backlit screen and the awesome animation if you are looking for an educational game that wont rot your kids minds with violence and nonsense this is for you!! I cant say enough good things about this. I have always loved Leapfrog products but so far this is by far the best besides the leap pad. I highly recommend this Leapster.
2,BEST INVENTION EVER!!!!!,"I've always watched as my 9- 10- and 11 year old nephewsplay their gameboys and now...my hardly four year olddaughter has a ""gameboy"" of her own...BUT! The best partis she is LEARNING so much and being challenged with everygame...more than any Pac-man or Donkey-Kong game I've ever played!Makes me happy I decided to start having children in 1999.:oP"
2,I think this is a great learning system,"We got this for our 4 yo daughter and so far she loves it. She does not get bored with it quickly at all....and it is educational and fun for her. I played some of the games to check it out. It lights up well enough, even when we were in the car recently at night, she could see it just fine. The screen is wide enough, and the quality of the images are good I think. Of course, it has different levels (1 - 3) which is great too. I was worried she might have trouble working it, since she has never had a hand-held game system before, but she had no problem at all."
2,"Wow, a great toy!","My mother sent the leapster to my son for Christmas, we didn't pull it until right after his second birthday. I was relucant to pull it out because of the age listed on there, and my son was not up to speed with a lot of things. Now (still 2)he know his shape, and it took only a matter of a few weeks. We also have the ""my first leapad bus"" He gets so much more use out of the leapster. I love it and would buy it 100 times over again."
2,one of norha's first books,This is a good book & keeps you reading to the end but as I saidyou can tell this was one of her first books. I would get the bookbecause I have read all of her other books and have re-read them many times over.This is a one time read and save.
2,Second attempt to make it work on toms with suspension system,"I have a sound business and wanted this product to avoid caring mic stands. It does work nice on snares, however, on toms is a different story. Most drum kits, specially beginners don't have complicated suspension systems on toms as some high end kits do. Gretch drums, Tama drums, even old Pdp's have a different kinds of suspension systems on toms that don't leave space to attach this D-Vice (EXAMPLE:Gibraltar SC-GTS14/6 14 Inch 6 Lug Tom Suspen System).Edit: After trying to make this work, I did find a way. I have uploaded a picture. It works for me. Hope it works for you."
2,Comedies don't get much better than this,"Tom Selleck is the mature father figure, Ted Danson is the ""look at me"" actor, Steve Guttenberg is the second string comedian. This trio meets one little bitty girl and their lives are forever changed. If you are looking for a relaxing movie with lots of fun, this is it!"
2,This is the best movie ever!!!!!!!!!,Stephan King really outdid himself with this movie. I saw it on sci-fi with my friend and go nuts every time I see it on again! It gets to you and makes you go to bed thinking that a Langolier will come out of your wall and eat you up with time. It is an absolutely fabulous movie. He is a really great writer and I think that everyone should enjoy this movie as I did.
2,good movie......really really poor effects.....too long!,"I found myself enjoying this movie....the plot was captivating....and the mystery kept my interest....I found myself, however, destracted by the really bad....and I mean bad...special effects....the movie would have been alot better on a bigger budget...and maybe at 40 mins. shorter...the first video was excellent as was the first hour of the second video...but it just seemed too long...i was fascinated nonetheless..but I wanted it to end....that aside...the movie was good....interesting....and at parts, scary...."
2,The Langoliers / Los Langoloides,"El mejor cuento del Maestro Stephen King e ideal para aquellos que quieran entrar en su universo...La mayoría de pasajeros y tripulación de un avión, desaparecen en pleno vuelo. Los supervivientes se dan cuenta que han dado un salto en el tiempo hacia el pasado, y han de volver antes que los lagolieros (que son los encargados de acabar con el pasado) aparezcan."
2,Something everyone missed in their review...,"Loved the movie. One noticeable point I saw was the ""prejudice"" if you want to call it that. Notice who survived and who died? The blind girl, the black, the foreigner (English), the mentally disturbed, died. Who survived? The white normal Americans. Just my observation...."
2,Great Movie!,Good storyline but the Langoliers could have been a LITTLE bit more real looking and the ending could have been much better. Overall rating about 4 stars.
2,"Stephen King, prognosticator","Extremely interesting tale which ultimately suggests an explanation as to why time travel to the past will never be realized. When a small group of airline travelers awaken to find their jetliner 40,000 feet in the air without a pilot and otherwise empty except for themselves, they come to the realization that they slipped a few minutes into the past. Now they have to find their way back to the present, for they have discovered the terrible truth of what really happens to the present when it becomes the past. Not the typical Stephen King story. But some interesting theory presented in the story line, extremely riveting with good role-playing by a diverse cast. Great entertainment."
2,The Langoliers DVD.,"I enjoyed Stephen King's The Langoliers. I loved the story as I am a sci-fi dude. The way the langoliers were shown, it was 90s effects at it best. It is something to be seen. I will say at least now we have programs you may use to create awesome villians. Dean Stockwell was in this miniseries (Admiral Al Calivicci from Quantum Leap). If you wish to be entertained by sci-fi, watch The Langoliers, you'll laugh. Get with the program! Gotta love Bronson Pinchot as a main anatognist. Recommened for viewing."
2,who rained on your paraide?,"This is a really good movie and I just have one question to ask you people WHATS WRONG WITH THE DANG MOVIE!!!!!!!!!!!? IT WAS REALY GOOD i thought.it couldnt beat IT though but it was good I dont see why your giving it a bad rating who rained on your paraide? yes , the special efects wernt the greatest the langoliers did kinda look like flying meatballs and it wasnt a horor movie but it was sci fi and i definitly recomend this."
2,Truly masculine,This scent is true to form. It has a solid citrus aroma accented with more herbal tones. Best to apply before dressing.
2,Bescor KLK-624,"Good product. Adds light to a dark situation. The light does not travel far enough, or wide enough, for a big group, when you have to stand back for the wide angle. But it is good for close-up shots, with a small group of people, or for a one-on-one interview. I would buy another with stronger light."
2,Now this is a guide on the path to freedom,The perfect supplement to the book Inner Temple of Witchcraft. I can not recommend this higher. It is perfect.
2,INNER TEMPLE OF WITCHCRAFT,A MUST READ TO LEARN ABOUT THE TRUTH OF HOW ALL HEALING TECHNIQUES ARE RELATED. HOW WE ARE ALL ONE UNITED BY THE SAME GREAT SPIRIT. THIS AUTHOR HAS TOUCHED ME AS NO OTHER HAS. I HOPE TO MEET HIM IN PERSON SOMEDAY.START WITH THIS BOOK AND GO FROM THERE. READ THEM IN ORDER IS MY SUGGESTION . I AM ALMOST READY TO START THE OUTER TEMPLE. I AM VERY EXCITED ABOUT THESE BOOKS
2,"Sweet, Entertaining, Nostalgic","""Cursed by a Happy Childhood"" is a memoir about growing up on the eastern end of Long Island (the North Fork), 100 miles east of Manhattan, in a rural setting. (This is not the Long Island of suburban/urban Nassau County, but of a far more rural, sheltered place, east of the corn fields and north of the touristed Hamptons.) The author wrote the memoir as a series of vignettes filled with both reflections on his own mostly innocent childhood paired with advice for his own tween-aged daughter. It is sweet, largely positive, and endearing. The ten-page postscript is the largest detractor of this book: it appears to have been written separately from the rest of the memoir (perhaps an earlier, shorter version), often repeating vignettes, examples, and phrasing from earlier in the book; it seems to have been incorporated last minute and appears to have escaped the red ink of the editor as there are numerous typos. Read the book, but skip the last 10 pages."
2,Works like promised.,"I read other reviews and I have used this item app. 25 times now and it works just fine, it workes like my old original one did 15 yrs. ago. The automatic function to load and unloed is good."
2,Good television movie,"This Stephen King adaptation of four past midnight is a good movie with very good specials effects. The script is also good even if the dialogs are bad. Fortunaly, the actors help much"
2,works great,I've been trying to find one of these for a long time. Exactly what I needed to watch my old tapes. No problems at all with it.
2,Brilliant!,Steve Poltz of the Rugburns is probably one of the most talented songwriters out there in world of music. All the songs on this record range from witty to downright funny to eerily beautiful. END
2,Never Grow Old,"All of these books by Thorton Burgess are timeless. My father read them to me when I was just a tot, his father read them to him, I read them to my kids, etc. I am now enjoying the memories and also reading them to my father-in-law, who is in a nursing home. Everyone should have a few of these books on their shelf!"
2,tAMAGOTCHI MADNESS,tamagotchi is so fun i love it me and my friend have it we connect almost all the time and it teaches me how to be a grown up since i'm 12 and 3quaters anyway you feed it clean after it(yuck!) and you keep it healthy like our parents to use my mom said what are you going to do when you got to school and sleep i said i'll feed it and clean it on the bus and a lunch put it on pause in class and when i go to sleep and then she was like who's going to buy it for you i was like me grandma gave money to me(thanks grandma!) so she took me took me to toys-r-us and i got nina my baby girl.
2,The best toy,This toy is fun i have v2 and v1 get them and play with friends and family it is so musch fun.
2,I LOOVE THEESE!!!!,"I have a v1 which I got last year for my b-day. Then I got v2 for Christmas. My brother and cousin got one forChristmas, too. The toy is A-W-E-S-O-M-E!!!!!!!!! Except that it can get lost easily and the screen can get scratched up. I'm planning to get a v3 soon. Probably this week or next week."
2,Crashing Cohn's Party,"This rather quirky selection includes 6/11 of a quintessential Al Cohn date originally released on the Dawn label as ""Cohn on the Saxophone."" The one contribution by Zoot Sims is certainly solid, and the three by Dexter Gordon include a rare appearance on soprano saxophone, but the effect is anticlimactic and distracting. Shame on Biograph (the reissuer) for not giving us the entirety of what is arguably Cohn's best work on record and a simply stellar example of mainstream modern jazz as played by five masters in absolute synch with one another (trombonist Frank Rehak's inspired solo work equals Al's). Regardless, there's sufficient material from a truly exceptional session to demonstrate convincingly why at least one of the three featured ""Tenor Sax Masters"" deserves the description."
2,Missing the point,"I believe most of the other reviewers are totally missing the point of this song. Sure, it's not one of Paul's best but I have news for you folks, you can't write a ""Let It Be"" everytime. Take the song in the spirit in which it was intended, to show Paul's support of the American people. He didn't want to get bogged down in sentimentality and he didn't have months to write one, he was hosting a benefit concert and needed a catchy tune. In that, I think he succeeded."
2,Ageless,"We've got NSync and Backstreet Boys CDs, etc., in the car, but my 7yr old and 12yr old keeping asking to hear ""Freedom."" There is a God."
2,Worked as expected,"This extension is being used for a monitor that is further from the computer box than the length of the cord that came with my monitor. It is working as I expected, I haven't done any tests on the monitor with and without the extension or using the old VGA port and a VGA extension. So, I have to give it 5 stars ... no problems."
2,Fantastic book,"I'm addicted to mystery / thriller books and this one kept me on my toes to the last page!Good plot, well written without unnecessary side plots this book will take you to a ""unexpected"" end!The ""who did it"" taken to a very high level."
2,Allegory?,"This surprising book might be the product of England's Darkest Hour (an Americanization of Churchill's ""Finest Hour."") Penhallow himself might be Hitler or Mussolini. His numerous offspring could represent Axis or occupied nations. It would be a game to try to piece all these elements together, But, I think it's a mistake to try to analyze the book outside the context of WWII. The Blitz had just ended, though I suppose it was difficult to be certain of that; Heyer and her family had just moved into bombed-out London. England had apparently lost a major war. The times were too serious for Regency frippery and I think Penhallow may have been the result."
2,Upside down murder story,"Penhallow is an odd story. Heyer spends about 200 pages introducing Penhallow and his browbeaten family, most of whom want to murder him, before he is finally murdered - and the reader gets to see the murder happen. The police are a side-plot at best.It's a creepy story and all of the main characters have nasty flaws that they let run their lives. I won't go through the list in case I give you a clue about the murder and the final twist in the end. They are compelling enough characters to reread the story but be prepared to do something cheerful afterwards."
2,Not your usual Heyer,"By far the darkest of Heyer's mysteries, Penhallow is more a psychological study. The intensity of the environment is a departure from the rest of her writing. Probably her best from a literary standpoint, but if expecting Heyer's usual comedies of manners, the reader will agree with last line found in the book...""A very unsatisfactory case.""DL"
2,Another great study guide from Progeny Press,"We thought that this was a wonderful literature guide and bible study in one! As to the previous poster who said the editorial review did not mention that this was Christian....she must of glanced over the word ""scriptural."" I wouldn't think of letting my child read this book without this guide to put it in context. It deals with very serious issues, such as abortion and euthanasia."
2,Helpful When Discussing The Book,"I found this study guide to be one of the best after comparing to other guides. My only complaint is that it covered the book too much (if you can call that a complaint)! Some of the answers to questions were too obvious for me to even ask the kids and I simply skipped over them. Otherwise, a very well, thought out study guide to the book."
2,"Simple, reusable and probably the best I have ever used.","I have tried many brands and styles of ear plugs. I have bought very expensive plugs and disposable plugs. I have never had better performance than I have had with these. It could be that these just fit my personal ear cannal better and you may not get the same results. But for me, I ordered the first pair and was so happy with them, I reordered 6 more pair just in case."
2,"It's not likeable, but its good","I have to totally agree with the above review. This book is excellently written! It is similar to Agatha Christie's 'Hercule Poirot's Christmas' - only Heyer wrote her version about 5 years earlier. An old man is the tyrant of his household. When he is murdered, everything comes apart. Georgette Heyer conveys the emotions of dispair and hopelessness and regret much better than Christie does in her version. The murderer thought things would be better, they're not, but the old man can't be brought back to life again. I didn't like it because I like more light hearted books - and this is not Heyer's normal light-heartedness, admittedly, but it is very well written."
2,Crock Pot Extraordinaire,"I LOVE the Hamilton Beach 33163 Stay Or Go 6 Quar6t Oval Slow Cooker. I was able to take it to the office filled with chili and not spill. I can't tell you how many times I have taken my old crock pot and have it tip over in the car, or elsewhere. Great design, easy use! Thanks so much! YEAH!"
2,Hamilton Beach 33163 Stay Or Go 6 Quart Oval Slow Cooker,The best purchase I've made in quite awhile. I don't know how I've cooked without one. Thanks for stocking this item.
2,Wonderful Crock pot,I bought this as a gift for my daughter for her birthday and she loves it. It is perfect for her.
2,Tight fit,"It was a little difficult to get the cover on because of the tight fit. With a little persuasion and insulation trimming the cover went on OK. I probably should have gone with twist lock plug and receptacle, but this works. Angle plug is great for remaining plugged in."
2,This is a great acid/trance/drum & bass collection.,Most techno CDs have a few good tracks and the rest are pretty sad. Acid Breaks and Beats is the kind of CD you can start at track 1 and listen straight through to the end.
2,Good size for a smaller child,"This bag was the perfect size for my 4 yr old. The gloves were way too big - even for my six yr old. My 11 yr old is running around with them. The bag is surprisingly lightweight, but durable. Good for some kicks and punches when aggression is running a little high. In a couple of years he'll need something bigger, but for the price and his age - it suits perfectly for now."
2,Why Do You Not Beleive,"What a great question to dwell on. After watching the movie 2012, and by reading this book convinced me I must so believe in my heart that God is real and He is there to take care of all that concerns my life. The knowing has to come from within."
2,Kicks hard!!!,"This sub kick hard, even with the low RMS and cheap price! It is very responsive. I bought this sub to listen to double bass for metal and it does it job perfectly. You can't beat the $40 price either. Highly recommend to anyone."
2,wow,"Honestly i bought this sub but i was skeptic,I was on a budget and man I was very impressed with the power and the quality that this woofer has. I have a 98 cavalier coupe so i don't need much for the car to start shaking.I have its hooked up to a kicker zx200.2 bridged and the sound is perfect, powerful clean bass. It definitely the most bang for the buck."
2,Jewel in the Lotus,"This is the science of red tantric kriya yoga. Red tantra differs from white in that it does incorporate sexual couple practice into the various teachings. It covers the general teachings, science behind it and various techniques and meditations. Highly recommend if you are interested in reaching spiritual consciousness thru physical sex."
2,"10"" Kicker Comp","Well I got this for free from a friend so I thought it was weak or didnt work but boy was I wrong! I would have never guessed that such a small sub could be so powerful! I have it running to a 240 watt amp so im overpowering it but its ok because kicker subs are meant to handle alot! installed it to my brothers car and he loved it, It was just perfect. BUY BUY BUY!"
2,Mysterious fun!,I loved this book. It's an original who-dun-it with a main character that will have you laughing the whole way through. Very well written and attention grabbing from the get go. I will definitely be reading more!
2,"Cute, funny,","I enjoyed this book for a quick read. I love humor by an author! This was not heavy reading, but brought me a smile and pleasure. I wish Josie would konk her mom, though. Amelia was ""sweet"" to quote her. I could identify with the main character. My life is much like hers. Sometimes the slick, smart, svelt, heroin is not like real folks. I want to read more of her books."
2,A bit of nostalgia,"I fondly remember this from my boyhood days. I loved it then, the rewatching was just as warm. The special effects are good when considered with due regard to the time the movie was released. Guy Williams is at his swashbuckling best, the villians are as over the top as one would hope for. Suspend your ""grown up"" notions of what makes a ""good"" film, kick back, relax with a bowl of pop corn and indulge yourself with some solid escapism. If you are able, gather the littlies around you and educate them in the joys of simplicity from a bygone time. Enjoy!"
2,Campy & Fun,"Guy Williams is in this movie. That gives it three stars to begin with. The fact that he plays the lead character with style gives it a fourth star. The costumes, historical value of the film and the fact that it is just a great deal of fun to watch gives it the fifth star. Guy Williams and an escape from reality for a while - what more do you want? If you like to have a bit of fun - buy this movie. If you are overly critical and think every movie should be a classic work of art, then pass this one by."
2,Charges Deep Cycles Well,"Purchased the SSC-1500A to replace a less expensive Schumacher charger that probably still works but would not indicate when a battery was charged. Have now charged deep cycle marine batteries 3 times with this charger and am pleased with the charge time and the results. It shows the percentage of charge, voltage and has 3 setting for the charge desired. So far I'm quite pleased with this charger."
2,Great charger,I have a optima boat battery that sits for the winter. When I got the charger I hooked it up with very easy instructions. Showed me the % of charge and volts. It's handy to know what is going on. I think this charger is great ! I would recommend it.
2,Definitely worth it.,"I would rather buy this $40 tool and an hour of my time to replace my spark plugs than pay someone $150 to do it for me. The next time, all it will take is the spark plugs and another hour. It it plug and play, so it really couldn't be easier to use and it works like a charm. All you need is a socket wrench, one socket for the tool, one socket for the bolts on the mounts, and a wrench for nuts on the mounts. Super Simple."
2,Bet you can't eat just one...,"And that's part of the problem. No, really, I can eat just a few, maybe more later.These thins are not quite as thin as I'd prefer (nor am I), but make a good snack. For hors d'oeuvres, if you top them with anything moist, do a few at a time; they get soggy pretty fast."
2,LOVE these crackers!,"Gluten FREE goodness.I've tried other brands, but they are not as good. Also other flavors don't float my boat the way this flavor does. I'll continue to purchase my case per month, I do share with my friends, but we await the delivery each month."
2,can't get enough!,"We jokingly call these our ""crack crackers"" and have been thrilled to get them by the box. Favorite toppings include almond butter and honey, avocado and ham with tomato, and when you really want to be naughty, a little nutella - though better on the plain ones."
2,Two Good Movies I Purchased from Amazon,"""Hanover Street"" has excellent actors - Harrison Ford and the beautiful Lesley-Anne Down. It is a romantic action/drama that takes place during war-torn Europe. You see how three people's lives are unintentionally intertwined, and I felt sympathy for each of them. The movie has a very surprising ending, and it made me realize how often fate comes into our lives.""Random Hearts"" is an intriguing mystery and, again, Harrison Ford plays his role very well.I felt this double feature 2-DVD set was a good buy from Amazon for the entertainment it provided and for the price I paid. I will buy several more to give as gifts to my famiy members."
2,Mollys Puppy Tale,"The American Girls Collection are good books to read. They teach you sharing, caring, and friendship. These books are great to read and so much fun.In this book, Molly's Puppy Tale, Molly learns how to share. Molly just got a new dog, Bennett, and she has been bragging to her friends how Bennett loves her and comes when he is called. When she gets home with her friends she realizes her brother Rickey has been playing with Bennett and Molly thinks that Bennett likes Ricky better than her. So Molly decided to not share Bennett with Ricky, and Bennett dose not like it. One day Molly had girl scouts and she doesn't come straight home to Bennett, and he tour apart Molly's room. So Molly had to stop her after school activities. It was too much for Molly, so she decided to share Bennett with Ricky.The author wanted to write about a dog because she has a dog just like Bennett. Her dog is loving, and friendly. So far he chewed up five welcome mats."
2,solid mix with some sparkling highs,"It's easy to see why the Blue 6 dub is the centerpiece of this mix; the track is so banging and gorgeous that it almost eclipses everything else here. There are other high points, though (the opener by Fluid X, the Attaboy remix of ""Touch""). I have to admit that I've always been a bit baffled by everyone's love of ""Earth is the Place"", though. It's an O.K. tune, but nothing special. There are a few filler tracks here, but overall this is a real solid set w/good mixing by Francois K."
2,Brilliant,"One of the best mixes ever and more than lives up to its title. A blend of soulful house with smooth beats. The way Strong Blend, Touch and Sweeter Love are mixed is especially cool. I have listened to this for years and it never gets old."
2,I love Francois K!,"This CD truly is deep and sexy. It makes me feel great. Perfect for a glass of wine with friends or significant other. I love Francois K, he never fails to please me with his DJing and production skills. Buy this CD, support a true artist and house music legend."
2,kfs2685,"My son loves it. Very easy to install. Keeps unwanted fingers out of his facemask, but more importantly it keeps those little black rubber chunks from flying up into his eyes when he hits the turf."
2,Look to the source,"This book may not be one of Graves' best but in the spirit of Gibbon, he captures his sources well. However, for entertainment and a more immediate sense of the history, you may find it more worth your while to read Graves' source: Procopius, The Wars (not The Secret History!). It is less sentimental and gives a more edgy account of Belisarius' struggles and incomprehensible end."
2,A satisfying sequel,"This is a nice sequel to ""Summer Pony."" Mokey (Ginny's pony) is going to have a foal, and Ginny and Pam are really excited. The book is fast-paced and enjoyable with lots of adventures. I only wish that there was a ""Spring"" and and ""Autumn"" pony as well!"
2,"good book, get the companion book too","My daughter loves horses and is starting to get interested in chapter books. We liked this book. It is an interesting story and is well written. There are only 2 books in this series, Winter Pony, and Summer Pony, and we enjoyed both. We have given the pair of these books as birthday gifts several times since getting them for ourselves."
2,Well made touching documentary,"This is a well made touching documentary about some of Cambodia's poor children surviving in an economy and society struggling to rebuild itself. Many of the children in the DVD are being helped by the Cambodian Children's Fund. If you would like to help or find out more, they can be found at: [...]"
2,"a Great book, for ethno-celtic-musicology, etc.","Any non-bluegrass type of mandolin Family interest would do well having this book, TRULY. HOWEVER, make no mistake. This will get you nowhere in producing a Bluegrass Mandolin. As long as that is understood. Nobody else will make the same mistake I made."
2,"Good phone with all feeatures, but lack voice quality","I bought this phone because it has two lines and sometimes I do conferencing. It has good features, basically what i wanted:- 2 lines, cordless and speaker phone. But, it lacks in voice quality. The voice is gone for some seconds in the middle, which irritates a lot sometimes."
2,Used but works well,"We bought this 2 line phone base used & the display on the phone is a little hard to read, but we also bought 2 new handsets to go with it & they all work fine. Love the fact that the additional handsets don't need the phone line, can be plugged into power anywhere & work. You can also save the stored phone numbers to the base or the accessory handet."
2,Love the flavor and crunch,Great flavor and love the snap! When your looking for something crunchy that isn't high in calories (a litle high in carbs though) these are amazing and you can have 17 crackers in a serving. I was buying them at an natural health food store for $2.79 a package. A much better deal for a case here on Amazon (about 1.00 less per package)
2,A Great Snack Cracker!!,"These are great crackers. They have a great crunch when you bite into them,and they are loaded with a wonderful toasted sesame flavor. My husband has diabetes and we went out looking for snacks for him to eat. These have no trans fat and 17 crackers is one serving.If you need to watch your intake of fat and calories for whatever reason you know how hard it is to find snacks that are satisfying and these are just great..."
2,Tamagotchi Time,Pros:You can connect to other peopleConnect up to 8 peopleYou can get marriedCons:Your Tamagotchi diesEgg takes a really long time to hatchI hope this review was very helpfull to you! ;)
2,AmAzIngly Fun!,This is a perfect toy for kids who want a pet but can't have them. Or it's a little pratice toy for them to prove they are responsible or not to have a real pet!I love how we can play games and shop with this little creature. It's way to connect with others is so fun to!Perfect gift to give anyone!
2,Fudd's Law,"The first side/track of this album is hilarious, but it starts to slacken a little on side/track 2, because the material is more suited to visual than aural presentation. Recommended."
2,"columbia, please offer us the surround version","Many of you may or may not remember Quadraphonic. It means four channel stereo. I use the word stereo because any two adjacent speakers could create the phantom center channel which today is played by the front center speaker in a typical 5.1 set-up.""Bozos"" was available as an SQ encoded record album or a discreet 4 channel 8-track tape. I have both. The SQ does'nt have really useful separation but the tape is awsome; blowing away the stereo version in at least four ways. Yes the hiss ls pretty loud (3.75 inches per second with 8 tracks per quarter inch)but the mix is great. Columbia (sony) should offer this as a 4.0 o 5.1 version but that means someone would have to do some hard work and research. We couldn't have that. Audience too small? Surround sound CD or DVD fizzled out?The stereo CD is available. After 30 listenings it gets even better.Good things and peace to you all. Remember Lana Clarkson.MIKE BRYDALSKI Buffalo New York"
2,Fantastic book,"Every now and then a book comes out that you've just got to have. If you're a flash person then this is one of those MUST HAVE BOOKS. For a start it's NOT that expensive (US$[money] rrp), secondly it's 1000+ pages of PURE reference.Flash MX has moved leaps and bounds in the sense of just what can be done with the Action Scripting engine inside. However as many people have noted and complained Macromedia failed to ship a printed Action Script dictionary with it. This book steps up to that mark - not just with a list of the commands, but in depth explanations of them.Loved it ... I use this book over and over and over. The only thing .. it's HUGE. I'm considering ""snapping"" the spine and getting the 2 halves bound ... one containing the AS Dictionary the other the first half of the book"
2,Excellent reference,"I just got this book for Christmas, and have already been through a good portion of it (and it is huge, so that is saying a lot!). A great holiday spent, even if it was practicing scripts!! This book answers a lot of the questions I had about ActionScript - and more. And the CD-ROM has a ton to offer as well: more chapters, reference files for all the code, and so on.Time well spent, gotta give it a 5 - and that doesn't happen often either."
2,A Truly Wonderful Book,"I fully endorse all of the existing reviews on this book, and I'm eagerly awaiting the new edition. What delights me is how it brings together into an understandable whole so much from the Old and New Testaments. The parables of Jesus and many of his sayings suddenly take on a new life. As I read through it (I am on my 4th read - it definitely repays reading again and again), I keep having ""lightbulb moments"" all the way, and my second-hand copy is full of underlinings and exclamation marks. I lent it to my Bible Studies teacher and he was impressed, which is a high recommendation indeed. If I could have only one other book apart from the Bible to help me along the path, this would be IT. Way to go, Dennis!"
2,Great New Year Motivator,"This book is an excellent study on understanding how every person can ""do business God's way."" Don't feel that you have to be a business person to enjoy this book. It contains 12 life principles that if followed will empower you to discover and fulfill your destiny. I have used this book in small group studies for our Marketplace Ministries class and it is enjoyed by all and said to be very practical while theologically sound. It provokes questions and answers questions that you've always wondered about. A must read for every person that is unsure of God's business in their life."
2,Translates the Word to Action,"Dennis' book was more than a refreshing read. The discusion leads you through biblical principles and how they may be aligned and implemented in the marketplace. The pricnicples are valuable to anyone who make a living in the commercial sector, and scales from small business to a multi-national corporation. Great assistance to leading an integrated life. Finally, i found the book helpful to build my underdstanding of the Word so i could translate general Christian point of view into a series of conversations for my family and workforce."
2,Doing Business God's Way,Great book. A 'must have' for anyone truly desiring to steward resources as God intended.
2,"Good, but in typical monaco fashion","For those of you looking for the 'next' New Order album, you may be expecting too much from this album. Die Hard fans of New Order may find the lyrics and tunes a bit simplistic and similar to the previous Monaco album. If you enjoyed Monaco's previous works, you'll love this one. Hooky's bass is as lively as ever and Pottsy's voice sounds better than his last effort. Overall, I'd recommend this album to all fans of New Order."
2,Excellent book,"Not just for business. It covers the business of Life from God's perspective as written in His book. Starting with the family as the center of a stable society it works out into the different levels of governance with solid principles. Have read it, listened to it, studied through it and purchased copy after copy to give to friends and family. Highly recommend!"
2,Best wok in its price range,"I am originally from China and cook stir fry dishes frequently. This wok is highly recommended. It is cast iron and heavy, so I can heat the wok to high temperature then add cooking oil (a Chinese stir fry tip: hot wok and cool oil). By doing this, not only it produces more authentic Chinese dishes but also reduces a great amount of smoke. The american open kitchen is usually not good for stir fry cooking, but with this wok and some careful operation, I can cook my favorite stir fry and keep the kitchen clean.Get it!"
2,Great read!,I read this book years ago but am still intrigued by it. It was a fascinating story of a culture I knew little about. The characters brought the reader into tight grips with the author. An exceptional read worth every minute of the time.
2,"Finding this CD isn't as easy as spilling the ""salt"".","Ever buy a compilation CD just for one song?Here you get at least three!!!There is a little bit here for everybody,including the extremely rare ""Salt in my Tears"".Killer early eighties angst rock well before Alannis was even conceived.Well,almost. If you can find this one available get it because it won't stay in stock anywhere very long."
2,This book is a must-read!!!!,"The Unexpected Storm was extraordinarily written. Filled with emotion, this book gives an honest perspective of a citizen soldier serving our country with dignity. The author, Steven Manchester showed how courageous he is by sharing his innermost thoughts and feelings. And he did an outstanding job specifically describing the physical environment in the Gulf region. His ability to help the reader visualize and feel what he experienced is remarkable. Veterans, or not - people of all ages should read this book!"
2,An Incredibly Emotional Journey!!!,"At the strong suggestion of a friend, I picked up this book...and never put it down! At first, the author poured the foundation with some very real and honorable characters. As the story progressed, to my own surprise, my tears of laughter were replaced with tears of compassion. Throughout this heart-wrenching (and heart-warming) tale, the author painted some very descriptive settings in which the Gulf War was fought. And it seemed that just as I finished the book and wiped my eyes, reality struck: This author didn't just escort me on an exciting adventure that he took ten years ago- he actually taught me to FEEL what he and his comrades endured...and continue to endure. He taught me why it's so important to remember! I think it's time to offer the same support we gave our Gulf War Veterans ten years ago. After reading this book- it is clear that they need it even more now!"
2,The Unexpected Storm: The Gulf War Legacy,"The Unexpected Storm was not only educational and emotionally provoking but also an eye opener. It was difficult to put down and the pages continued to turn. This book will be appreciated by not only the men and women who have fought for all of us, but the book will also be appreciated by friends and families of those individuals. It opens closed minds to facts that many of us don't want to even consider never mind believe. The author with his admirable courage has given a voice to those soldiers who have been silent for so long. After reading The Unexpected Storm, I have a greater respect to all those who have chosen to fight for our freedoms clearly at their own expense."
2,Superb resource,"For the student of Galileo, I can't think of a better collection of superb papers, most of them inspired by the recent opening of the Archives of the Holy Office. Essays include a review of how Copernicus' work was viewed by the Church prior to Galileo's work, as well as excellent pieces on the documents related to Galileo's trial. Contributors include all the leading Galileo scholars, including William Shea, the late Mariano Artigas and McMullin himself. While the authors are rightly critical of the Church's role in the affair, they point out, given the documentation and testimony, that Galileo's own actions ---over the course of the initial general injunction against Copernicus (1616) to the time of his own abjuration (1633) --set himself up to at least the credible perception of having dealt deviously with the Holy Office even if he did not."
2,Pretty good.,"I am pretty sure that most people buying this would be New Order fans...like me. This was pretty good, but their prior CD (Music for Pleasure)--which unfortunately doesn't seem to be available anymore was MUCH better. As a matter of fact I thought that CD was fantastic! I would still buy this one, if I had it do to over again."
2,Best Pet Bedding I know of,"This stuff is decently priced and great great great! It doesn't start to smell until about two weeks. And you wouldn't want to leave any bedding around forever. Bedding can be expensive as often as it is replaced.I like the price for this stuff especially for the quality. My guinea pig loves it, and I love it. It is a win-win situation."
2,Totally sweet,i love this phone. it is a great phone to take pictures or video. the built in mp3 rocks! and the sleek metal design is great! also t-mobile just makes it all the better with the my faves. if i didnt have that i would spend most of my minutes on just 5 people. all around great phone!
2,good cd with some variety,This cd has a lot of good songs. It isn't just one of those cds that have only one good song. Almost all these songs are good with a variety of medleys and types of r&b. I recommend this cd if you are a rap OR HIP HOP or r&b fan. Its a keeper.
2,Good flick,"The movie is not funny, but it is well written, and I particularly enjoy seeing Goldblums thought process, wrestling with himself over right and wrong, while G is always one step ahead of him, knowing that Goldblum will ultimately do the right thing. I was supprised at how intellegent this movie was. Wow, why is this movie was so harshly criticised by other Amazon visitors?"
2,Holy Man- 1999,"I discovered this film via an old VHS movie, with a handful of previews ofupcoming releases that show at the begining, (before the feature presentation).If not for this fact, I never would have known of it ... its a very good filmthat depicts how RIDICULOUS and PETTY our society gets about commercialism andcapitalism, over and over again. The lead characters are all great in theirroles, showing the negative aspects of over aggressive sales-pitching and theeffects on all of us.There are also some funny cameo appearances by various stars.Thinking of this movie being made about 12 years ago, do you think we have gottenbetter or worse on the subject?"
2,Funtastic,"I purchased this for my 9 year old daughter. She loves it. Her big sister has helped out, too. It's challenging, but fun. Comes with 3 models to follow so you can change the appearance. Now the girls are looking at making their own design."
2,My 6 year old loves it!,"I bought this for my daughter's 6th bday, even though the manufacturer recommends 8 and up. She has always loved legos and I thought this would give her more to be creative with. We haven't tried creating the actual townhouse yet, (there is a thick booklet that looks like it might take a while), but my daughter and 8yr old son love creating their own houses. It comes with 3 books to make 3 different houses. It is definetely a fun child-parent project. The only thing I wish it came with was more of the little decorative pieces like more flowers, doors, and windows. I would recommend it."
2,teaching kids great lessons without them even knowing,"My son got this for his 12th birthday. He wasn't allowed to pick any lego that did not have over 1000 pieces or else it would not be challenging enough for him. As soon as he got it, he went straight to work and I enjoyed the pleasure of my son learning how to follow step by step instructions and build his fine motor skills without him even realizing. There are different styles you can make which also helps build creativity and decisiveness. Great toy and would highly recommend!"
2,SUSAN DOES IT AGAIN!!!!,"A great extension to ""Feel the fear and do it anyway."" Susan lists a lot of different excerises that can help you get better in time.She gets right to the point of the matters again.""Feel the fear and do it anyway"" is still a classic. I would highly reccemend for all of you to read her first one before this one. However, do what you like. THis is a great sequel but I still found ""FEel the fear and do it anyway"" to being the best self help book of all time. This is still a great book, but it's just a big extension from her first classic.One of the more rememerable moments in this book was when she says over and over again. ""What a great reason to do the exercises!""It's a great sequel and will help you all that are suffering from anxiety and depressive related illnesses. You just gotta give it time and make sure you aren't allowing your fears to get in your way of making you healthier and stronger."
2,Feeling the Fear,Half way throught the book there are a lot of exercise and personal work for the individual reader. Trying to read through one time and then read again and do the accompany work. Insight thoughtful. Personal crises and stories and the author personal battle with cancer and overcoming. Up lifiting make you feel better about yourself and makes you ralize that we all have fears and we need to over come them to be able to move on with out lifes. Enjoyed the book so far.
2,BORDER HEAT builds in tension like a blood stirring bolero.,"""The heroine possesses not only physical beauty but internal as well. The rhythm of this story makes it a fast and exciting read. I highly recommend this one for all romance fans""."
2,Great Product,I already purchased this mem before and was adding another 1gb to max out my old computer. Highly recommend this product!
2,NOT A FOUR PACK,"Dr. Woods is freaking fantastic. It does everything Dr. Bronner's magic soap does but for a fraction of the price and with the added bonus of shea butter. However, if you order from Cosmetic Solutions, you should be aware that the great deal you think you are getting with a four-pack of 32 oz. bottles, is not real. You will get only one 32 ounce bottle. However, $8 for one giant bottle is still a killer price."
2,Gotta have it in the summertime.,"This soap is ""must have"" for Florida summers. And with the shea butter added, it's just a bonus. Leaves you and your shower smelling good."
2,"Great phone, terrible manual.","I bought this phone as a gift for my girlfriend. She was trying to use the manual to familiarize herself with the various features. Unfortunately the menus described in the manual don't always match the menus on the phone. This is very frustrating for her, which means it frustrating for me. I'm returning the phone."
2,Good phone,"This is a good phone, offering a wide variety of new effects that are on phones.The one thing I would say I don't like is the sound quality on the earpiece. The phone can be hard to hear on, even set at level 7.Other than that size is great, quality seems good, picture's are so-so, no flash.But if your looking for a good phone, that is fun and nice size this is the one."
2,Decent phone.,"Basically this phone is like the V360. With fully customizable softkeys. The only gripe I have is the MP3 player software. I have a 2GB micro SD card. The phone works with it with no problem. But when I try to load more than 800MB worth of music in seperate folders, I think the MP3 software has problem generating the directory of songs. I tried reducing the number of mp3's to put in and it works fine. Also the mp3 player doesn't have fastword. All else works very well."
2,Utterly Captivating,"You'll laugh, you'll cry it's better than Cats!! But seriously it's touching and entertaining. It shows you the talent and character of Charles Nelson Reilly."
2,It is a goog product,I'm not a pup and i have had and used Many chargers in my life. I have had very good service out of this company's products I have one of there onboard maintainer chargers mounted under the hood of a Cadillac XLR if that tells you anything.
2,Brilliant!,CNR is irresistibly human. Barry & Frank feature him at his best. The show & movie are brilliantly dynamic. Funny & heart-wrenching at times. Just like life. Beautiful film & man.
2,Best of Bette Midler,"I love Bette Midler as an actress, but this is by far my favorite of her movies- and the final screen shot is my favorite of all time. This is a classic, pure and simple, and should have you falling out of your chair laughing."
2,Better than the last edition,"I own both the older edition and the new edition and I find that the new edition is much easier to use. Not only is there an index for most items, but there is a breakdown of the foods by phase, which was lacking in the previous version. It is very helpful, however, I still feel that it is lacking in some food choices. I hope that the next edition has more foods listed."
2,DON'T GET RID OF IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Burnout Revenge is the best racing game i've ever played in my life! The crash mode is a blast, has a ton of cool cars, has sweet tracks, it's fun to play it with friends, and the career mode will last you a while. It's well worth the money. You'll LOVE it!"
2,Just a quick note BURNOUT 5 I did not actually rate this game to my opinion,"Just for all you Burnout fans and if you're not, buy the game, plop it in to the console and glue your eyes to the screen for the next 6 hours.BURNOUT 5 is coming out shotly after the PS3 does in November and is for the PS3, maybe PS2, i'm not sure about xbox, and not on any Nintendo We-We or whatever the hell it is. I'll tell you my review, in a bit."
2,THE ULTIMATE RACING GAME EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,I RATE 1000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000 STARS AND RECCOMEND THIS TO ALL PEOPLE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
2,Rocks - just get it,"BR has a gold and brownish tinge to it that makes it look more realistic than B3. While B3 felt like a crash game with some racing, BR feels more like a racing gaming with some crashing and a lot of aggression. At this level the game is more satisfying than B3 since racing games at their core are about racing. Added this year are hidden pathways and the ability to take out traffic in front of you and send cars and vans flying into other cars. This ability allows you to simply take out your aggression. Tracks are laid out beautifully with the ability to catch air with ramps. Simply put, there is little need for other racing games."
2,"I like, ownze this game","Wow. An awsome sequal to Burnout 3. This is one of my all time favorite raceing games.Pros:Blowing up your rivals when they take you out.Plowing threw trafic and nailing your rivals from behind with a taxi.Beautifull tracksAwsome graphics.Cons:The music 5uck5, turn it off.Camera gets shakey when boosting.The new launch bar in crash mode is stupid, getting a fast launch is next to impossible.The cheering in crash mode can get on your nerves.All and all an awsome game for anyone into raceing. get this game now."
2,Very easy reference,"This is a really great book that can be carried around and referred to easily. It has almost every imaginable food in alphabetical order so it is easy to reference. Great book, I use it constantly."
2,Aesome game and a great seller!,I had a great time playing this game with my nephews! I am glad that I got it here through Amazon brand new instead of at the store used. My nephew played it at a friends house a while back and wanted it for his birthday. We had a great time.
2,Minnetonka Moosehide Mocs,These make great house shoes; I wear them all the time. The leather is incredibly soft and supple and feels great on my feet. The left moc seems to be a little bit smaller than the right but after wearing them for a few days it stretched out and broke in nicely. If you're looking for a house slipper that won't make your feet too hot these are definitely for you. They are well worth the price.
2,My Third Pair,"I love these mocs - this is my third pair over a period of 7 years. They last and last, and get more comfortable the longer you wear them. Pair #2 isn't dead - just headed to a shoe shop for re-stitching. At 3 years old that ain't bad !!I'll be back for a fourth pair in a couple more years !!"
2,Excellent overview of American politics,"This book is an excellent overview of American Politics. All major facets of Politics are examined through the precise art of meticulousness as well as the smaller, lesser known events and daily occurances of political life. I highly recommend this book to any student of politics or anyone who is eager to learn more about the way this country is run."
2,Exit right to funway,"I love this FST album. The main reason for my review is to let everyone in on a secret.Everything You Know is Wrong has been released on CD.&The Tale of The Giant Rat of SumatraIn The Next World, You're On Your OwnNow I just need Firesign Theater 'Chat' and 'The Three Faces of Al' released on CD"
2,One of FT's best,"This is one of FT's best albums, second only to ""Don't Crush That Dwarf, Hand me the Pliers."" Very much worth listening to repeatedly (all their albums stand up to multiple playings; there is a lot going on in all of them)."
2,"""Go Ahead, Squeeze the Wheeze!""","I think that this is my favorite of all of the Firesign albums, and in my view, one of the most accessible to neophytes, especially in its use of computer and theme-park imagery. They got it a long time before the rest of us did. Many quotable lines (""Mr. President, it's the bees and spiders again!"" ""Ah-Clem!"" ""In the beginning, there were hot lumps."" ""If you push something hard enough, it will fall over."" ""It goes in, it must come out!"" ""Live it, or live with it!"") And, to whom it may concern, PLEASE put out ""Everything You Know is Wrong"" on CD!!!"
2,So soft!!!,I got these for my boy friend and we both loved them. Really well made. Maybe I should get a pair for mr..
2,great little book,"Love this little book. Great as a quick reference--packed with info. If you are a SouthBeacher, don't be without it."
2,Helpful information,This book has very helpful informaiton in it. I reviewed the information before going shopping so I knew up front what I wanted to buy.
2,The Encyclopedia of Technical Market Indicators,"The best technical analysis and indicator encyclopedia. Comprehensive, best refernce.The only book yoy will ever need. Not a dictionary of indicator, complete analysis and trading models explained."
2,RUTHLESSLY FUNNY,"The AZA express (the Airplane/Naked Gun) team was in full force in this uproarious comedy from the eighties. There are so many hilarious scenes, and the cast performs them with slapstick gusto. Aside from the leading roles helmed by Danny DeVito and Bette Midler, we get great support from Bill Pullman(""possibly the most stupid person on earth""); Anita Morris as DeVito's sexy mistress; William B. Schilling as the athletic chief of police; lovely Helen Slater as one of the kidnappers; and even Judge Reinhold (whom I've never really liked that much) is fine as the inept kidnapper. Midler's raving and ranting is worth the price of the movie. A trendsetting comedy, RUTHLESS PEOPLE should leave you in stitches."
2,"Very Funny, Possibly Danny DeVito's best!","If you like a silly comedy then you will love ruthless people. This movie is about a wife(Bette Milder) getting kidnapped and her husband(Danny DeVito) not wanting to pay the ransom. The kidnappers treat Bette Milder so good that she loses 20 punds and even has her own tv. Danny DeVito pops the champagne and and sheds tears(of joy). The kidnappers lower the ransom from $500,000 to $10,000. It's a nice light comedy. My dad and I call it the ""Headache Cure"""
2,"'I've been kidnapped by K-Mart!""","Extremely funny movie. Danny Devito plays the part of a husband who married his wife for her money and now wants to get rid of her (he's got a girlfriend on the side). Bette Middler plays the loud-mouth rich wife. Just when Devito decides to put his plans into action, she is kidnapped. He is thrilled and refuses to pay the ransom hoping the kidnappers will follow through on their threat to knock her off if he doesn't pay up. While he's laughing and celebrating, the police think he's mourning. The kidnappers find they've taken on more than the average kidnapped victim, especially since they are really a soft-hearted couple who felt Danny owed them for ripping off the wife's idea. Bette Midler is no tame, soft spoken woman.The movie is one of those side-splitting comedies that is great from the start to the finish! Enjoy!"
2,Funny Movie,"Now one must know that anything with both Bette Midler and Danny DeVito will not only be a rather good movie but a funny one as well. THis movie is both of those as Bette continues her hit movie standing here. Bette again plays a rich wife who is kidnapped by some inept people. Once she discovers that her husband does not want to pay the paltry ransom, she combines forces with the kidnappers to turn the table on her husband and get the money. Judge Reinhold and Helen Slater are great as the kidnappers as they do a fine job. Bette once again steals the show with her red hair and fiery attitude. She is also very funny which helps the movie alot. Just a great movie from the 80s!!"
2,The era of Bette,"1986 to 1989 were big years for Bette Davis on the movie scene. In 1986 she filmed Ruthless People with Danny DeVito and the lesser known Helen Slater (Supergirl fame). Ruthless People, while a bit dated, has some hilarious moments and needs inclusion in any Midler collection.Who could forget the kidnapped Midler lifting paint cans to keep fit and lose weight. Well, it's one way to keep yourself busy while being kidnapped.Bette went on to star in the funny, but not as good as, ""Outrageous Fortune"" with Shelly Long.DVD SUMMARY: Ruthless People is a bare-bones DVD. However, worth owning for the Bette factor alone!"
2,Don't Make 'Em Like This Anymore,"What a funny movie!!!These days all comedies use the same tired formula, filled with low-brow humor. Boob jokes, urination jokes, flatulence jokes, jokes about virginity...and show people as absolute meat-heads.Not this movie. It has a great plot, great acting and it's funny, funny, funny..."
2,This makes me happier,I love this stuff sooo much. I can't eat popcorn without it. I'm glad they don't sell this stuff by the kilo
2,Russian Wedding Band,"Sterling Silver 3-Band Russian Wedding Ring (Size 4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11)Nice sterling Silver Product, I purchased a large size for my thumb, I have not taken it off. Wears great, only polished it once. I am over 50 and wanted something different yet suddle. For the price it is worth it, I have seen them around priced higher. It is a really nice sterling silver ring."
2,Size?,"I ordered a 7, because that's what size she wears. I wish I had ordered a 6.5 or 6. It wasn't THAT big...but I wish it had been a bit smaller. Otherwise it was great!"
2,"Pay me now, or pay me later...","Just got a 63"" HD Plasma and live in an area prone to lightning. Was not crazy about paying the price, but am very pleased that I did. Well built and plenty of plug-ins. Just a little added insurance to ease my mind that my tv investment will be protected. Highly recommend"
2,A book that redefines the genre...,"Challenge The Wind is a vivid masterwork of historical fiction that brings to life the world of a fifteenth-century Basque adventurer, and does so with a great deal of accuracy and perspective. The author's extensive research is evident in the rich, detailed background into which she skillfully weaves this exciting and emotional tale. Challenge The Wind represents a historical and cultural renaissance that will force the reader to reconsider the very nature of personal, religious, and national identity."
2,Great artwork with relatable characters.,"My daughter loves the artwork in this book. She especially likes the female kitten and the bunny in the wheelchair. She reads the English independently and enjoys going flipping through the pretty pictures on her own. My only critic is that, like most children's books, the story is somewhat predictable. However, it does have a great moral lesson that children easily derive on their own."
2,I highly recommend this book.,"My sister gave this book to my daughter as a birthday present last week and my daughter can't seem to put it down. It has beautiful illustrations and a storyline that warms parents' hearts. I especially recommend it if you have ever heard your child say ""I want to join the circus"". I highly recommend this book."
2,Cool diverse characters,"My son really liked this colorful book. Especially the diverse group of characters like the rabbit in a wheelchair, the brother and sister cats, and of course BOPO the turtle. He is looking forward to future adventures with these characters."
2,A Valuable Resource,"Robert Colby's book is a valuable resource for any practitioner of technical analysis, or consumer of technical analysis reports. Every TA method one is likely to encounter is explained clearly, and in detail.Colby's bent is toward the science of TA, which is both a strength and a weakness here. His book places considerable emphasis on the backtesting he has done on the TA methods presented. The results are interesting, but would have served better as material for an appendix."
2,Smooth,"This was the PArty Jam back in 96""..this song has soem smooth deep base and gets the heads turnin on the streets..and bodies movin in a party!!!!"
2,Sweetness,I must say I enjoyed this expansion pack a lot in filling in a lot more gaps that seemed to of been sitting in the game when I bought it. I do enjoy the additions of races and more complexity to building various things and working towards a specific goal. A+
2,ship-n-shore charger,"Great charger,I use this charger for everthing from motorcycle batteries to deep cycle back up batteries to a 12v 900 ah ups battery. works great keeps the voltage much higher and fully charged than any of the standard type chargers."
2,Light and versatile to use and operate.,"It has some interesting features on it that you wouldn't normally find in a inexpensive battery charger. I like the fact that it will charge my Optima batteries as well as conventional ones too. If it would do 6 volt batteries, I would give it the addition star. The circuitry makes it lighter and more versatile than the old box of bricks charger, I never found it getting hot as others suggested and the fan runs fairly quiet in the shop, though I haven't used it as yet on charging the trailer battery while we slept the night away.I found that you have to run the de-suffication cycle a few times to bring the battery up to full life. I am presently experimenting with bring back a dead cell battery, I have that cell up to 1.04 Volts from a .2V starting value, if it makes it back to 2+ volts, we'll see. The other 5 cells are 2.2 to 2.4V, it will still make a good 'summer' battery."
2,Great regardless of price!,"This is a great set of headphones for the price. Would even pay a bit more for them. They are pretty big and are really for home use. I wouldn't take them out rollerblading. Good long cord, good sound, good volume control. Only complaint, I wish that mute button would stay down. It only stays muted when I hold it down."
2,Sweet Headphones!,"I had a pair of Discwasher Headphones for a while which put out some serious bass and had an in-line volume control. These Jenson phones are from the same company as the Discwashers I had. The 40mm driver in these Jensons are 5mm bigger than my old discwashers. I just sold the Discwashers to a friend b/c he never heard such awesome sound on headphones before. These Jensons are better! I am so happy. They are at a DANG GOOD price, sound awesome, and have a great volume/mute control. I don't believe many heaphones can compare to this one especially for the price."
2,Great deal,"I've purchased these same headphones before.... They sound and feel great. My only complaint is that you have to be pretty careful with them. I've broken three pairs in the past several years. I am a bit clumsy, though. :)"
2,Jensen,"I've had this pair for about 2 months now, and I really like them. The sound is actually really nice, and crips with nice bass. These headphones are comfortable for like about an hour or so, but wearing them for a long time will make your ears heart A LOT. There is also another flaw. IF you have a small head, these headphones make you look like idiot because they are exceptionally big, and look weird, kind of like some alien communication device.Overall though there is nothing extremely bad about these headphones and they will suit mostly everyone who buys them, and I highly recommend them to anyone seeking good sound."
2,Best Headphones for the money.,"These headphones are excellent quality for the money. I have purchased 50-60 dollar headphones and they do not compare with the Jensen headphones. I have taken these headphones everwhere. They have even held up on 30-40 School Sports trips. That takes a lot. The bass and excellent quality. I would recommend this product for anybody that uses a discman alot, and they handle on your hears perfect."
2,"Quite satisfied, unfortunate disaster","I was quite pleased with my headphones, which I purchased mid-january to use in my dorm room. They were somewhat uncomfortable with extended use (2 hours or so), but they felt pretty good, and I never had a problem with sound quality. A few days shy of the end of the year, the plastic on the un-chorded side split cleanly in two, for no apparent reason. However, for 15 bucks, AND with a lifetime(!) warranty, I still highly recommend these. I just ordered a nicer pair of sony open air ones, but these served me well."
2,One of the best stories you'll ever find. Period.,"I was given this book by my father, who met Sidney and said he was a heck of a guy. That alone is a glowing review. I have been born and raised in Alaska and even though I lead a more urban life, I could relate to and picture most of the accounts in this book. I think the more time you spend in the wilderness, the more you would appreciate this book. Hopefully, those of you who have not been in the wilds of Alaska will still get a lot out of this book. This book is without question one of the best books I have ever read (And I'm comparing it to classic literary works as well). I am not an emotional reader, but I had tears in my eyes more than once while reading it. One should pay special attention to the section on wolves - it is the real story - the one the animal rights activists don't want you to know. Sidney bridges the native and white cultures so well - I think both cultures would be better off if we lived to his ideals."
2,Five years old and still pumping out the music!!,You cannot find a better set of speakers for the money. I have had these for five years with no problems and they are still the same as when I bought them. There is a handy volume control on the speaker cord. Buy these and you won't regret it.
2,A very practical guide,"I've had this book on my shelf for quite some time and often lend it to new team leaders. It is very simple and easy to understand, giving practical examples of all the concepts presented. Highly recommended and stands the test of time well."
2,NICE!,"Eventhough the movie director didn't follow and cover the original story of book in this movie, i think this movie is good because Jim and Huck had free from their previous situation at the end of the movie (Huck got free from civilized society and Jim got free from slavery. Likewise, we can see both movie director and Mark Twain have same purpose because in my opinion, conclusion shows their final messages. Therefore, the conclusion is really important in our life.Some people doesn't like this movie because the movie skips a lot of important parts of the book. For example, Tom did not show up in the movie. In general, the movie can't show everything within limited time(usually 2 hours length) So, i think the most important thing is to send a message. MAny people also disappointed about the movie Harry Potter but everything depends on your feeling. For me, this movie tells the main ideas from the book and shows great scenery with good actors.I recommend this movie"
2,A Rocking CD,"Originally released in 1995 this is a sweet CD that hasn't lost it's charm over the years. If you appreciate upbeat blues full of juicy guitar you'll enjoy this band. Just listen to ""Wound Up"" all the way through and you'll know exactly what I mean and while that tune alone is worth the price of admission, this recording is ""jammed full"" of solid music."
2,My Man Mark May,"Get anywhere near Houston, see my man Mark May and band. Real fine players, great guys, great song selection and great blues-men.Tell them to wear their USS Houston CA-30 T-Shirts and honor our traditional and current vets."
2,Not horrible for the price I paid.,"Well, when i first connected it, I thought, eh, but then i thought, damn, I paid 235 dollars for this 20 inch television with a 4 year replacement warranty on it. So thats not so bad. Its not horrible but much like the other user review stated, you have to be a couple of feet away from it. Its a perfect offering for someone with a small bedroom that wants a good cable feed or something similar."
2,As good as Bergstrom's MINA!,"Ms. Bergstrom does it again with another exciting vampire novel - this time a continuation of the author's earlier work, ""Mina."" I wasn't expecting to like ""Blood to Blood,"" as much as Mina, but I did. The author's adept ability to create atmosphere and mood are here, as well as her right-on characterizations of Mina, Jonathan, Arthur, and Van Helsing. Bergstrom stays true to the characters Stoker created, but she lets us get to know them better. On center stage with Mina and her friends is the half-sister of Dracula, Joanna. I don't want to give any of the plot away, so I'll just say that the story is seductive, fast-paced, and suspenseful. Fans of ""Mina,"" ""Dracula,"" and other vampire fiction won't be disappointed."
2,Looks funny...,"The headphones are alright... I like the way the volume control is... but when you put them on, it's another story. Your head will look like a light bulb or something, I laughed when I saw myself in the mirror with them on."
2,Does a great job,Does a great job of grinding up coffee or spices. Easy to clean and store. Does what it's advertized to do. Every kitchen should have one. Motor doesn't seem to bind up or strain.
2,"excellent reading, marvellous storyline;a history epic",I was so intrigued with the enormous way of living and the many skills involved with just survival.
2,Awesome,"My daughter is very happy with her Tamagachi, she is now learning the meaning of responsibilities, by taking care of her tamagachi."
2,a good read,"This book is interesting and keeps your attention the whole way through! At first I was kind of irritated at the author for not giving Olivier, the cute French guy a chance. But then towards the end of the book she starts to realize she has to let things flow and not try to control them. She seems to feel more at home in America than in Europe and starts to unwind a bit and then she falls in love! She planned her dates with no down-time at the beginning and therefore was grumpy all the time! It makes you realize how important it is to always have time for yourself alone otherwise you can't enjoy things no matter how nice they are. Better to travel to one spot and stay a while than to always be on the move and tired.Great book!"
2,so much fun!,"Am a) from Seattle (via Portland), and b) member of the Burningman community as well, and I have to say WAY TO GO JEN!LOVED the book, highly entertaining, amusing, and fun to read. I think it took me 3 days (not incl work time).If I ever run into you @ a burner event, a coffee/drink is on me!"
2,Beautiful stories by one of Raymond Carver's writing teachers,"This is a collection of wise, graceful, richly composed short stories about people who live in on the northern coast of California, which happens to be where Day himself has lived and worked for several decades.It so happens that in the early 1960's Day had a student only few years younger than himself. His name was Raymond Carver. Day's stories stand on their own -- in fact, when you read these stories you can't help but wonder if Carver didn't first learn his habit of careful observation in Day's writing workshops.These are terrific stories and they deserve many readers."
2,great seller,Totally satisfied with all aspects of the purchase of this book. My husband loved the book.
2,Wow!,"I am impressed! Not only did this unit come with a wealth of power options, it is really a quality product. The picture is crystal clear and has played type of media I have tried. It's light and very easy to use. No problems or complaints from this end1"
2,"Great product, great price","I decided to invest in a DVD player to keep my 2 1/2 year old toddler occupied on a cross-country plane flight. This product was definitely a worthwhile purchase. We have had no problems with the player so far, after use on 2 roundtrip plane flights as well as daily usage for a week in the hotel. The battery life is reasonably good, and the picture quality is good as well (no problems with skipping either). My only complaint is that the battery pack is pretty heavy, so the entire unit weighs a bit more than I expected it to."
2,No other optical cable has this incredible construction.,The manufacturer has made a really solid Toslink cable with the most increible metal fitting. The lens construction also help improve the signal transmissions to make my system's sound great!
2,Campolo delivers,"Tony does it again! In ths book he has succeeded in inspiring, offending and educating. If you are a die hard evangelical you should read 1 Tony Campolo book a year just to give you some balance from the ultra right wing Christian media you normally subscribe to. Toney is a prophetic voice in a very sterile Christian communityI loved this book, It was well thought and bold. His chapter on universalism was the only chapter where I felt he rambled and made no sense. He basically laid out the cause for universalism and thin in 1 paragraph said he doesn't believe in it. Besides one weak chapter I would recomend this book."
2,Thank God for Gray,"Essentially, this book boils down to this: the further off in the weeds we get, the less likely we are to have a monopoly on the truth. Tony's assertion of evangelicalism boils down to the Apostle's Creed and the authority of scripture. We're in C.S. Lewis-land at this point. The fights begin once we start getting into how those essential beliefs (the 'mere' in 'Mere Christianity') inform our action: our social and political world views.Tony gives us a glimpse into the formations of many of his world view lenses. It's a fascinating process - one that many of his self-righteous critics have probably never bothered with. Why, when some bumper sticker at the Christian Gift Center will tell you all you need to know? Tony knows enough to know that he doesn't know it all, and I'm thankful for that. Plus, he's not waiting until he's got it all figured out to make a difference: shaking things up and getting us out of navel-gazing ways.Preach it, Tony. This seeker is glad for your voice."
2,GO 4 MAXELL,"Great product,fine top quality! I've been using MD for about 5 years now and 90% are Maxell MD's.They come in varied colors,good to organize collections or categories.Cool slide case too!Definetly the best portable recording/playback digital media.Sound performance is best(cd like) when recorded with optical cable.You won't miss your tapes!"
2,Cook Up Some Family Fun,"This is such a great idea! This book uses popular children's literature and provides an activity and a recipe to go along with the story. The activites are interesting and easy to do (i.e. they usually require objects or ingredients that one has around the house) and the recipies are really quite tasty. What a great way to enhance the reading experience of a favorite book. This books is great family fun. One small note, I would have liked to see suggested age levels for each title since I am not familiar with every book included in this activity guide."
2,Some of the best music ever made.,Rich Mullins was an incredibly talented musician. His work sounds like nothing else. This album is one of his best.
2,A fascinating precursor to Edward Tufte's work,"If you are interested in making scientific plots, or any kinds of statistical graphics for a wide audience, Edward Tufte's series and especially hisThe Visual Display of Quantitative Information, are indispensable. Reading William S. Cleveland's The Elements of Graphing Data, you can see where Tufte drew much of his inspiration, and where he expanded, clarified, and improved upon Cleveland's ideas. Much of this is simply due to advances in computer graphics, personal computers, and printing and display capability - it's been 27 years since Cleveland's book was published, and the WWW didn't even exist then. Cleveland certainly isn't at fault for the technical limits of displays in his day, but for the modern reader and chart-maker, Tufte's work is more instructive and is a better starting point."
2,tamagotchi is awsome,"I got my tamagotchi about a year ago and so far I have only had to change the battery once. You can play with it, feed it, give it medicine, train it, flush the toilet, connect them, praise and punish it, and check its weight. They are so much fun. They also are educational because it teaches young children to take resonsibilite about their pets."
2,Not for the comfortable Christian,Tony always makes you think about what you believe and what Jesus would have you do. Fantastic book if you want to take Jesus' words seriously.
2,Nice and sturdy product,"I use this little grinder for making powdered formulas for my dogs. I grind up oats, flaxseeds and eggshells (egg membrane is a main ingredient in those expensive dog joint health pills). Everything becomes a nice fine powder and the noise is minimal. The grinder itself is mostly stainless steel. It comes with a small brush for cleaning, though I bought an extra one just in case. I took off one star because this can be a bit hard to get clean. After I sweep it out, I use a slightly damp paper towel to wipe it out with. You have to be careful while doing this as you can cut yourself on the blades. Overall, this was a good deal. It's a well made and stylish grinder."
2,Another cuppa please.,"We replaced an old grinder with this Saachi. It is surprisingly quiet. We don't fall into the highbrow coffee drinking crowd; we just love a good cuppa using decent beans we grind ourselves. The Saachi is perfect for our needs and we hope it has a decent life cycle to it. It looks great next to our Cuisinart coffee maker. Although we are Illy fans for our espresso (which we brew in an old school moka), I would be hesitant to use the Saachi for an espresso grind."
2,Great little machine,"Great machine. I gave it a 4/5 only because I think the blade could be a little bit sharper but you can't beat the price and it still does a stand up job grinding coffee beans for my press. I like that it has an area underneath for the cord since I don't keep my appliances plugged in all the time as this wastes electricity, which is bad bad bad for the environment :)"
2,Foundation of random processes,"It's the best book I've read about Random variable mathematics. It's not very easy to get the concepts for the first time, but after some detailed readings you figure how all make sense. Who likes formula handbooks won't like it."
2,Twin Heroes,"The author, Kimberley Anne has presented Twin Heroes at my elementary school. The book was well received by the children and generated discussions on how the children felt about this tragic incident. These children reside on an Indian Reservation in Arizona; yet, they felt that Twin Heroes provided them with a way to express how they felt. This book is an excellent teaching tool and inspirational. There are no other books of this kind in the local libraries. I would highly recommend this book to all teachers and librarians."
2,SPECIALITY LEGEND !!,"As well as his speciality buddy, Little Richard sharing the same label with Larry Williams, they both should be sharing the same spotlight together in the ""hall of fame"". It's a shame his life ended so tragically with a single gun shot wound. Their records will live on and on !!"
2,Fantastic!!!,"This is one of my favorite CD's from a collection of over 300. It and the other Cate Brother's CD, ""Struck a Vein"", are permanent selections on my 5 disk CD changer. My favorite selections are ""There Goes the Neighborhood"" and ""Damn Guilty Blues"".The performances, sound quality and production are all first rate.BUY IT!!!!!!!Robert and Clara Diane Stancliff"
2,DISCO JAMMING DOLLY,"I LOVE THIS ALBUM! SHE DOES EVERYTHING FROM POP\ROCK TO COUNTRY TO DISCO! GREAT CD! I WISH BUDDHA WOULD RELEASE ""NEW HARVEST,FIRST GATHERING,GREAT BALLS OF FIRE,DOLLY-DOLLY-DOLLY,ANDMY TENNESSEE MOUNTIAN HOME!"
2,Crossover Success,"Heartbreaker was yet another venture into pop music, as well as disco, adult contemporary and country, for Dolly Parton. This album offers many sounds for the listener, and includes some of her nicest songs. The hits include Baby Im Burnin and Heartbreaker, both timeless, but the other songs are just as timeless (even today), with some classic ballads like Were Through Forever Til Tommorow, Its Too Late To Love Me Now and Ive Really Got The Feeling, while singing fun songs like With You Gone, Sure Thing, I Wanna Fall In Love. I reccomend this to fans of Dolly, although the country fans of Dolly might find this one disapointing."
2,The classical text for engineers,This is the classical text for understanding and applying stochastics processes. Papoulis gets to the formal point!
2,this film is excellent,"I have had this film on video for about 10 years and I have seen the part with the little boy behind the curtain more times than the producers, I have never seen a shotgun or a knife and I've never seen it him move, but also I don't think it's a cutout of Ted Danson, this has puzzeled me for 12 years, there are other scene's in the film shot in the same place and the ""cardboard cutout"" isn't there. Why would somebody put it there in the first place then move it to a different room later on, and beside's the ""cardboard cutout"" is wearing jeans, I don't know if that is custom in America but here in England we wear trouser's."
2,About the boy in the curtain I found the truth,"In the part of the movie where Jacks mother comes over and then you see a figure in the window. Well a couple of years before the making of the movie a little boy commited sucide out the same window they were shoting at later finding this they pulled the movie out of the threaters and have never showed it on tv networks after what they found and they said it was a cut out not true it is a ghost with a hat, shirt, and jeans on him and he blinks in a split second after they passed it."
2,"The ""ghost"" in the curtain",Who is that ghost in the curtain? I heard he was a real ghost of a boy who died on the set before the shoot the film. But then I read on the internet that it was a poster of Jack in a tux. But how do you explain the shotgun in the window as well? And it changes! Watch for it in the seene where Jack's mother comes over to see the baby! Check it out and let me know!
2,3 men and a baby,it was a very good tape. perfect .... I looked for this movie for a long time and finally you had it. thanks......
2,This was such a good movie.,"This was such a good movie that I had to buy it. I now have both (Three Men and a Baby and Three Men and a Little Lady.) Anyone who ask I have to tell you, wonderful movie."
2,Fine Entertainment!!,"This older film, dating back to 1987, was a sleeper hit and a real favorite when it came out. The cast of Tom Selleck, Steve Gutenberg,and Ted Danson was just fine, and the story line was terrific. Here we see three ""professional men"" having to deal with the realities of life- a baby- and the predicaments they have to deal with are realistic and not patronizing at all. Then to discover that Danson is the real ""Daddy"" brings an even greater element to the film.I believe that this had to be one of Selleck's best movies, and the ensemble cast is excellent. A fine family film, and to watch and listen to the trio sing ""Goodnight Sweetheart"" is worth the price of the movie."
2,great movie,Some movies you can watch over and over again and Three Men and a baby is one of them! Love the price too!
2,The boy in the curtain....,Goodness! ALL of you have me scared to death! I saw it when I was a little girl and LOVED it. But I never saw the boy in the curtain part.PLEASE e-mail me about it before I have a heart attack! AshleyAACK@hotmail.com
2,help for Lisa marie to find the pocket sized bible,Lisa if you are looking for a pocket sized douay bible it's at ebay right now in auction!! go get it!!! it a very very good featurs in this bible!
2,Inspiring!,"I just had to borrow that word from another reviewer here. It best describes this bible. Douay Rheims Version, if memory serves, is the first English translation, predating the King James Version. With the archaic language this bible is best read slowly, enjoyed like a fine meal. I very much wish someone would come out with a pocket edition. I found a pocket size New Testament at Tan Books . Com - if anyone wishes for the same."
2,Nice Basic Phone for the Price,"Nice basic phone for the price. Worked as expected. Coverage is good. Voice quality a little tinny, but whatchu want for this price?"
2,grinder,We use this item to grind up fresh pepper for our meat rubs. Make it so much faster than hand grinding
2,Awesome for coriander!!,"Got this as a gift off my wish list. I wanted it for the surplus of coriander seeds I harvested, so finally got a chance to try it. I wasn't sure what to expect - it's very simple, but it works beautifully. The included brush helps dislodge the finer powder from around the blade base. Easy to use, love the cord wrapping base, too. Note that the ventilation is also in there, so unwrap the cord all the way. I haven't seen it overheat but I noticed the airflow and it was mentioned in the instructions. I did about 30 seconds and it was just about as good as a store-bought jar. I like my spices a little coarser, so I stopped there. Awesome!"
2,"it's good, but not all stainless steel","The only reason why I chose this spice grinder was because it was advertised as having all steel housing. With time, the plastic top of other spice grinders I have owned has deteriorated and cracked. Hence, I jumped at the opportunity to buy a stainless steel grinder. Well, that was disappointingly not true. The top is plastic. While the plastic portion is smaller than that of similar grinders, the plastic top does come in contact with the spices and I am convinced it will follow the same fate as other spice grinders I've had. I'll make sure to update this review over time."
2,Great value,"I needed a spice grinder so I ordered a Krups model from Amazon. It arrived with a vertical crack on the curve of the plastic up near the stainless steel cup. Amazon sent me a new one promptly and it had a crack in the same area, though it was a smaller crack. I never heard of Saachi but decided to take a chance after reading the reviews and ordered their grinder. It arrived promptly and works great. No cracks as it is all stainless steel. It's much more attractive and I'm very happy with it."
2,Best spice grinder I bought,"I was in the market for a spice grinder & not really a coffee grinder. This is my second spice grinder & the last one I'd buy or recommend. The construction is very well made, feels solid and works well. The grinding blade sits low enough to give you just the right level of fineness I wanted when grinding spices to make a rub or marinade or even toss in the pot to cook with.The cable stores well wrapped around the base and cleaning up of insides is easy too."
2,Superior Product,"This grinder is exceptional! Very even grounds and so much better than my previous grinder. Haven't used it for grinding spices yet, but am looking forward to testing it out in that arena as well."
2,Nice Grinder for My Herbs!,"While not advertised as a herb grinder, this works well for my herbs. Many times herbs come in dried plants, roots, etc. that need further grinding to better fit into capsules... this grinder does the job nicely! Much faster than the pestle and mortar method."
2,A fascinating and very well-researched book.,Havana USA is a very thorough account of post-revolutionary Cuban migration to America. One of the interesting aspects of Cuban emigration since Castro has been the perspectives given to us by the media and the government - many of them misleading. Garcia dispels these myths with facts backed up my extensive research and personal interviews. A very interesting read.
2,A Beautifully Written Book of Hope and Inspiration!,"This work of fiction and non-fiction is a very refreshing, creative and inspiring work. It is a very unique story of 5 women whose lives have been changed by the soul stirring music and lyrics of the R & B group Maze Featuring Frankie Beverly. As the author stated, it will take your mind for a flight on the wings of Frankie's Angels. I experienced the emotions of the joys and pains of the Angels through this writer and you will too. As an avid reader I am thrilled to add this great work to my bookshelf. You will be too. B. Shaw of Los Angeles."
2,Continues To Please,"Like the first, the second book of White Wolf's latest trilogy is a great read with plenty of suspense, intrigue, action, monsters, and gore. Also like the first installment, it maintains a much quicker pace than many of White Wolf's other publications. Thus far, this trilogy has provided several illusive and incrediblly fasinating characters. If you like horror and the concept of people willingly facing off against all manners of evil then this book is for you."
2,I-Dog fun!,I bought this for my 6 year old son for Christmas and he loves it. He is a huge black suited spidey fan. He has plugged in everything from his mp3 player to the TV and games. It takes on a personality all its own.
2,Excellent Phone!!,"Excellent product, looks perfect, quality is good. Cons: It can fall to the floor easely."
2,Happy,I was very happy with this purchase. I purchased this for my mother who was in desperate need of a new cordless phone. She called me as soon as she received it and sounded great.
2,easy to integrate into our office,"Doesn't have a whole lot of features, but it's perfect for what we needed -- a simple, easy-to-use single-channel cordless that would work with our office phone architecture."
2,Great little phone,"The main appeal with this phone is that it's black,(sometimes in retail I have found it hard to find any color other than white), has a small footprint, and it works well. What more could your ask."
2,Great toddler/child stories. Please write more,I love the story lines. We have two of the Beatrice and want more. My daughter asks for these at bedtime.
2,"""Living with Wolfdogs, Second Edition is a must read.""","""Nicole Wilde, has done it again. She has added new information and guidelines to her already by far, the best book on Living with Wolfdogs. This is a must read for anyone who loves and cares for these magnificant animals. Thank you Nicole""Michelle Silmon, Founder, Grandmother's Rescue Center, California"
2,Good Intro book for wolfdog ownership,"This book is a great introduction for anyone who's living with or thinking of living with a wolfdog. It's short and easy to read, with lots of good pictures. It also provides a fair view of the potential pitfalls of wolfdog ownership, without overly glamorizing or demonizing these wonderful creatures. A wolfdog is not the pet for everyone. This book can help you decide if it might not be the right pet for you...before you find out too late that it isn't."
2,A must for anyone considering a wolfdog or who has one,"This book is a must for anyone who is considering a wolfdog or for especially a new owner. Its packed full of tips, hints, great pictures and essential information. The author has a sense of humor, which you must have to own one of these animals. A step by step guide I won't be without."
2,Wow!,"Wow. Amazing narrative poetry of a very self-aware young girl. Annie is a runner and an artist. Her mother is expecting a new baby, her grandfather has Alzheimer's and is slowly slipping away, and she spends a lot of time with her neighbor and competitive friend Max. The novel made charming use of footnotes and grammar. It's a poignant and beautifully told tale, with simplicity and heart. I wept. It was beautiful."
2,Must Have,This is a must have for Havanese fans - this book would be a great addition to puppy packets for new owners. Beautiful pictures. Alot of info in an easy to read manner....END
2,Love this stuff!,"Heard about this on a BBQ podcast from Grate.tv. Tried it on fried pork-chops a few days ago and tried it on a sirloin tip roast with vegetables today. Both dishes turned out wonderful. The hint of garlic with the rest of the spices gives you just a little something extra than you can't get from other seasoned salts. It is quickly turning into my ""secret ingredient"" for some of my rubs. Highly recommend!"
2,Great for seasoning!,I used this to spice my chicken before grilling and the taste was great. I use it for soup and stew and even use it to cook rice. I'll recommend it to anyone who is looking for something tasty in their food!
2,tamagotchis are soooo cooool by luke,well i think tamas are cool because its fun to see them play have second gen and shope at the store. i realy like to shope but its hard to find boys who have tamas. im a boy and i think its just hard to hind people let alone get a second gen. any way you have a small screen but its all you realy need. to find out more go to www.tamagotchi.com/ and if you have a v3 go to tamagotchitown.com/ by
2,Fun,"Tamagotchi Versions 1,2 and 3 are lots of fun. Its like having your own pet but you dont need to ""really"" clean up the poop. It is somewhat educational with how it teaches you how to take care of a pet but other than that there isn't much. Tamagotchi is durable. If you drop it, it won't break. The only thing that will hurt it is water since it is a electronic.Tamagotchi has games and you have to feed, play and overall just take care of your digital pet. Oh, another thing is that with the infrared connector at the top of the toy allows you to connect with other tamagotchi toys and play games and exchange presents between your tama and the other person's tama. You will not get tired of your tamagotchi for a long time."
2,heartbeat,my name is zoeie and im 11. i love this book the way its set up with the poems and everything. my favorite poem in this books is loves and fears. i would recomend heartbeat to anyone and i have recomended it to 5 people. heartbeat is my favorite book and i give it 5 stars.

2,"Cute,Cool and.........Virtual?","Well I just got my exactly yesterday.But I can tell you the pros and cons.Pros:.portablity-5/5.funablity-3/5.pause feature-3/5.attention given-4/5Cons:.instrustioons given-2/5.the fact that they die if you dont take care of it even if you do the right thing-1/5.disobeidence-2/5.the other fact that teachers confestcate-0/5Thus you can see that this cute,loveable pet can be a burden if not taken PROPER care of."
2,If you love Bluegrass...,You'll love this CD. What a great journey this soundtrack takes you on musically. I loved the movie and loved the music. Allison Krauss is pure delight !
2,honestly bought because of jack white,"but got more than I expected, this is a good soundtrack to listen to when just relaxing or when you really want to pay attention to the lyrics. Also I'm going to have to get some Alison Krauss discs now because her tracks on here are probably the best ones. Definetely a soundtrack that stands out."
2,Powerful and Haunting,"It appears that most, if not all, of the poor rated reviews are from users in Illinois. I too am from Illinois, but find the opposite. This soundtrack is riveting and very overwhelming. The style of music here is a step back into time using raw and untrained bluegrass. Many people interpret this as a failed attempt at a bluegrass soundtrack, but keep in mind that bluegrass does have many roots spread across the east, through the south and into the midwestern area giving different sounds to bluegrass.If you enjoyed the movie, you will certainly enjoy the soundtrack!"
2,Excellent!,"After seeing the movie, I bought the cd because I enjoyed themusic very much. If you enjoy good old Southern accoustic music,this one is a must. The lyrics all strong and the music great.One of the best!"
2,Good stuff,"Exactly what Jack White needed: to team up with the rest of the big guys, a mandolin, and a violin. Allison Krauss and Cassie Franklin are incredible as usual, and Elvis Costello's assistance in writing is a definite plus. I LOVED IT!"
2,I NEED INFORMATION FROM ALL YOU PEOPLE WHO HAVE TAMAGOTCHI'S,"Hi i am 11 and i need some information on tamagotchi i dont have one yet but i am saving up my money for one. and i need help,first of all i want to know how to operate it and i also want to know what you do with it. please e-mail me at flower_princess11@hotmail.com please e-mail me.thank you"
2,love this book read it in one night for school and i wouldnt eat untill i finished it,omg best book ever wrote i love this book i have even had my friends read it the loved it to i like how it makes you feel what the person feels and i always felt like i was there i really like how the characters act they act like people my age amd it feels like im with my friends every time i read thank you sharon creech
2,Books to start them reading....,"Sharon Creech has become a favorite author of my 10-yr old. Starting with ""Walk Two Moons"", he has become a better reader, finding content in Ms. Creech's books that keep him interested. After completing the first book, I made it a point to purchase the rest of her volumes to keep him on the 'reading path'."
2,Great Book,I absoultly loved this book. I couldn't put this book down. Sharon Creech is a really great author.
2,Great basic charger.,Great basic charger. Easy to understand instructions. Lightweight. Digital readout lets you know what percent of the charge the battery has.
2,SSC-1500A from Amazon,"This particular charger has all the features I was looking for with the bonus of having a ""test"" function to identify bad batteries. It is a step above the regular type charger that is heavy (works from a transformer) and better fits my needs. The price was much better than I fould locally."
2,Does the job but is noisy.,Does a fast charge and tells you the % and voltage level of the battery.One problem I have noticed is that it will say the battery is 100% (but not done) whenI use if off a generator. I don't notice the same problem when using commercial power.The fan is a turn off but it does get the job done.
2,Deep discharge battery charger,"I use this charger to charge a deep discharge battery used for camping. The inverter used to change the 12 volts from the battery to 120 volts AC must be turned off when using this charger. The inverter drives the battery charger into flashing all lamps and then shutting down. With the inverter off, this charger works great. The multiple displays are nice. I particulary like the percent of charge readout. This is a good product at a fair price."
2,Great charger,Works great nice charger for the money nice digital display. Tells you how much of a charge is left in the battery nice
2,Great little charger,Fast shipping and put it to work right away. Does duty in my yacht and at home for charging all of my batteries and maintaining them.
2,HUSBAND LOVES IT !,"Uses it for charging our 2 boats and a drag strip racecar. Works wonderfuly. Great display, easy to read. Very pleased. Is used numerous times during the week from April to October. No issues as of yet."
2,Excellent battery charger,I have used this charger many times to charge the battery in a car that sits outside and I rarely drive. The voltage and percent charge display is very nice. Very easy to use
2,Casual user,Printing on controls very small; hard to read. Made in China so insulation on leads stiff with small guage wire. Electronics seam okay.
2,Review,"Exactly what I needed,it has also helped me with looking for new batteries. Sizing and maintaining them I recommend this model"
2,Very satisified,This is a quality product at a great price point. It does exactly what I need for my auto and deep cycle batteries. I am also pleased with the compactness and the length of the warranty.
2,Schumacher SSC-1500A Charger,"I read the reviews on this charger and I was hoping it would bring back my AGM battery. I followed the advice of others when the charger stated the battery was ""BAD"" and restarted the charge cycle. It took 5 tries, but it finally fully charged by AGM battery. I will not leave the battery connected in the car next winter. But the charger did bring it back from being completely dead. I have not used this charger in any other application at this point. But for what I used it for, it worked for me."
2,Almost perfect,"User manual and the display button is a bit confusing. The user manual shows 4 selections for the battery type but the unit only shows 3 (missing the marine battery). The fan is noisy and if you leave it on 24/7, better put it somewhere outside the house, maybe in the garage."
2,Great book in verse!,"Sharon Creech writes this touching story in free verse poems. This format paired with strategic repetition allows the reader to feel the rhythm of Annie's story. From the ""thump-thump, thump-thump"" of the running to the ""a-whoosh-a-whoosh-a-whoosh"" of the baby's heartbeat, Creech's utilization of onomatopoeias bring the story to life. The flow of the verses also lends itself well to developing Annie's voice. Heartbeat is without a doubt quality poetry/children's literature. The novel portrays emotion, insight, and a fresh viewpoint. Creech's effective usage of language and poetic devices gives Annie a sincere voice that readers can connect to. I absolutely loved this novel! I was intrigued by the realness and complexity of the relationships between Annie and the other characters."
2,The Amazing Heartbeat by:Justin,"This book is about a girl named Annie. She likes to run with her best friend Jack. Her mom has a baby. The girl's track team coach keeps on nagging Annie to play track. She is assigned to draw an apple a day for 100 days.I liked thes story a lot, but I don't think that it was perfect. My favorite part was something near the end. But if you want to know what it is, you'll have to read the book. This book was amazing. It kept you on the edge of your seat. I think that everyone of all ages would like this book."
2,A good CD,"If you liked the music in the movie then you'll enjoy this CD. Even my kids enjoy listening to it, then again, they like many different kinds of music and this isn't your typical kid type, but much of it is really upbeatish and they dance around being silly. Alison Krauss' songs were just beautiful too."
2,SSC-1500A,Used this charger a lot over the past few months. Using the 15 amp mode it takes about six hours to charge a trolling battery that has been run down to 65% capacity. The registration did not mention an online website. Here it is: [...]
2,Great soundtrack of something different,"At first I didn't like this CD because I was scared away from the new sounding songs. But the songs are addictive and they are really very good. There's nothing left to say except that this type of music isn't really for everyone, but it's worth a try."
2,For What It's Worth,What a combination! Releasing a soundtrack that would pit traditional southern critics of bluegrass against rabid White Stripes fans from Detroit! I'm sure that Jack White isn't the only performer who is delighted with the controversy this album generated. Musicians just love the music......it's the critics who need to take a hike. This is a great album that showcases BOTH great traditional bluegrass AND well known rock musicians displaying a love of the human feeling that is embodied in bluegrass. So.....quitcherbitchin and enjoy it for what it is.....a nice soundtrack to a movie that showcases bluegrass for a wide popular audience!
2,Turner Classic Movie Version,Recently TCM showed Bros. Grimm in a widescreen transfer that had alll 3 camera angles visible. It was great! Write them and request a rebroadcast and then get your DVD Recorders ready!DonAtlanta
2,LOVE THIS BAG !!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Have been so HAPPY I purchased this handbag ! I wish all handbags were this roomy and "" comfy "" to use !"
2,No 75mm holes,"A couple of points: There are no 75mm holes, so when mounting to an adjustable arm, you may have to use the plate which changes the mounting arm from 75mm to 100mm, then attach this adapter as well. This adapter may be a little oversized if installing on a monitor with a recessed, or flush mount bracket. Due to this, the supply screws weren't deep enough to me use. I had to go to the hardware store and get ones with the right depth. Used on Samsung Syncmaster 245BW and Ergotron LX Desk Mount."
2,Premium Set of of 750 Casino Del Sol 11.5 gram Poker Chips w/Case,I chose this rating as this set is very nice for the price. The only issue of note with this set is the handle on the case itself which has not presented any issues but feels cheap. The chips themselves are excellent. Would recommend this set as a good starter set for anyone.
2,Great Stater Set,"I have played countless hands in countless places with friends in the past 8 years of playing poker. I have never owned a poker set of my own since one was always present at the places I visited. I decided to get this set and it's really cool. When it was handed to me, it seemed almost too heavy for just a bunch of poker chips (around 30 lbs). But besides being heavy to lug around for periods of time, it's fantastic. The only thing that would make this set absolutely perfect would be $50 chips. They have a number of $25 and $100 chips, so it's not really a problem, but just a nicety. Chips feel great on the felt and are easy to shuffle when not in play and quite stackable. If you're an experience poker player, this is a pretty good deal and I'd recommend this set for any casual poker player as well."
2,Excellent Chip Set,"This chip set offered every thing I was looking for, the feel and weight are right on target.I like the denominations printed, for my family we really find that helpful, even if it pegs us a rookies. It helps avoid confusion, and increases this confidence of all players during betting.To be honest the cards are a toss in, I have replaced with a nice set of plastic decks.Love the clink, and the weight of the chips.Speaking of the weight, when you pick up the case, it is real heavy, and the case seems iffy. Seems to bow under the weight. Holds together, but I would not be suprised to see it fail someday.Can't miss on the chips, the rest of the kit does not match the quality of the chips, but I purchased for the chips."
2,Comment,The movie has its drawbacks1. The tom thumb scene was not in the movie.2. The yawning man scene was not in it also.3. Quality seemed to be lacking.
2,West meets East,"Rebeccasreads highly recommends 31 MONTHS IN JAPAN as a must for anyone planning on traveling to or working in Japan. It teaches about & shows a very different lifestyle, & how our American ways of doing things can make for both funny & embarrasing moments. Throughout, you sense the authors' excitement, their appreciation of beauty, hard work & friendship.Elegantly presented, in simple & brief language, 31 MONTHS IN JAPAN tells the saga of how Larry & Lorna Collins got there, the inevitable culture clashes, setting up house, social gaffes, typhoons, festivals & construction woes, together with photographs of the team.A unique & engaging read."
2,Great pair for slick people,"These earphones are so much fun - and they don't hurt at all! They are fun because no one really knows you are listening to them (when you're wearing a hood), and you look really cool with them. I love them, but mine just broke (after about a year). I'm buying another pair because I love them so much."
2,Excellent book about an important individual,"Very good book about one of the most important figures in modern conservation. Marshall was one of the co-founders of the wilderness society and was instrumental in helping create the national wilderness preservation system. He also helped with places such as the Adirondacks and the immense Gates of the Arctic National Park in Alaska. This book provides an interesting summary of this man's extraordinary life, including his famous 40 and 50 mile day hikes!"
2,Interesting,Good book on some of the history of Bob Marshall. If you are interested in the Bob Marshall Wilderness area in the Flathead National Forest you should read this.
2,You Can't Go Wrong,"I have owned this item [four of them now] for at least 15 years. I'll not buy any other brand. Flick of The Wrist? Yes indeed which is why I don't care for the Leatherman type. While working as a painter I need just about everything on these through out the day. Flip open the pouch, quick flick, use the tool, press the safety buttons, press the pliers back in, back in the pouch, back to work. Gerber says the scissors can cut thru seat belts: they can, Fiskers is the brand of that feature and they are well respected. The black knife-like tool is/like diamond encrusted and cuts thru some amazing things. The serrated knife has stood up to some brutal punishment as well and I am just amazed at how much this whole tool combo can handle, I am not easy on tools, I don't have time to be. This is one heck of an awesome tool............."
2,Great Father's Day Gift,We bought this gift for my Father-In-Law because he likes to fish. He loved it.
2,give it a try,"Despite the negative press the Ezzos have gotten for their advice on infants, they know their stuff and have great lessons in how PARENTS need to take the time to raise their kids with manners, self control and respect. We have a 10 year old daughter that fits the mold of a preteen: forgetful, negative, needs to speak to adults with more respect. This book addresses those issues and gives practical advice on how the parents can change that behavior by presenting it to the preteen in a way that makes sense to them instead of the parent constantly nagging. As Gary says, these years are molding who they will be as teens and this is the time to train them to be respectful teenagers."
2,Unique Opportunity,This is a unique opportunity to learn about the trials faced and joys experienced by business professionals entering into another country to build a theme park. The book describes the journey that Larry and Lorna took from monsoons to tea houses and from surfing to theme park rides. I enjoyed learning about the customs and found myself wondering if I could have weathered the adventure as well as they did.The book is an easy read and well worth your time to explore these 31 months in Japan while building a theme park.
2,Recieved in time,Child hood favorite Many stare in the movie I enjoyed growing up. It also telles a little of the life of Brothers Grimm
2,I was 6 yrs old when my mother took we to see this!,This was the first movie my mother and grandmother took me to see. I have never been to a indoors movie before. I enjoyed watching all the stories but the one who took my heart away was elves! I have the album that was sold from the movie. This is a keeper!
2,Beyond Ecophobia,"Great book, wish I had found out about this before now, easy to read and full of common sense concepts"
2,what you would hope for,"If you saw the movie Cold Mountain and you enjoyed the music that you heard, then you will not be disappointed by this album. It is a wonderful, consistent collection of roots music. If you like this music then I recommend you check out March 16 - 20 1992 by Uncle Tupelo, Ain't No Grave by various artists, and Fantastic Expedition by Dillard And Clark."
2,A Must See!!!,"Spirituual Warriors the film truly took me on an amazing and exciting adventure. As a huge fan of Lord of the Rings and Star Wars- this film gave me the same experience in traveling to worlds that are fantastic and unknown. From the Pyramids of Egypt to battles with demons and terrifying creatures- this story kept me enraptured, tapping into universal truths, revealing the turbulent yet great journey that all human beings go through, Spiritual Warriors is wildly entertaining and truly uplifting.-Actress/Writer-Jaime King"
2,marvles book,This item deserves spending time on becouse you would bild ur abilities specialy if u r an artist. i would recommend it for every artist to have it in hand. thank you
2,You don't rate something 1 star because it's not who you think it is.,"I'm just posting this 5 star rating to offset the ignorance of someone leaving a 1 star ""review"" because it's not something they were looking for. If you have no opinion on something, then don't post one. You do not degrade another artist because they have the same name, or you misunderstood, or bought something without paying attention. I have no idea who this artist is either, but this post invalidates the previous inept action."
2,Great poker movie,This is one of my favorite movies. I finally bought the DVD a few weeks ago and I've watched it about 6 times since. The acting in it is great. There are so many lines from this movie that I love to quote. My friends and I watch this movie a lot while we play poker. It is a typical Matt Damon movie. If you liked Good Will Hunting and others like it you'll love this movie.
2,The Cinncinati Kid backwards?,"The first thing i'd like to say is as soon as i finished watching the film i wanted to watch it again. I think the way the film starts is brilliant, losing 30k in the first couple of scenes-what a gripping start. Now refering to my title. In the Cinncinati Kid The kid has it all to play for at the start but loses it all by the end. In Rounders Matt Damon loses it all at the start but has it all to play for by the end. Also they both lose their girlfriends and there is a cheat involved in both films. However Rounders is a Excellent film with great performances by Damon & Norton, i would recommend this to all film lovers."
2,"Drumwest Reviews Vol. 3, Ruins of the Reich",This volumn continues the excellence in the preceedomg two volumns. The parties producing this series should be commended for the Historical facts that are presented in a most informative way. I will look foreward to Volumn 4 and beyond. This is more than just an historical collection. It could well be a text for academic reviews at the highest level.
2,so much for so little.,"As is the case with many Edirol products, this little device gives you quite a bit for your dollar. It functions simply and flawlessly as a 3x3 midi interface, and you can daisy-chain up to 3 devices for 9x9 midi ports.My only real complaint is with the midi-thru functionality. There are no dedicated midi thru ports; instead, edirol has provided switches which, when enabled, echo the input ports at the output ports. This would be great, except, when you have the thru switch enabled, the device doesn't capture midi from the input port (at least not with my software). snaaaaaarfoh well, at this price, just buy a couple. You won't regret it.~Maitland"
2,great!,"I felt I could relate to Josie. As the author says in the book, the best story is one where you feel you're eavesdropping on the people sitting at the next table. That's how I felt. It was a quick read, not too many difficult words, not hard to pick up again, and sympathetic characters."
2,Believable characters interest this reader,"a touching story about a young woman's discovery about where her life is at; not yet 30 yo, and she's already dealing with questions about the solubility of her marriage. very interesting for this reader because i am about the same age as the reader, though not in the same situation. enjoyed the utter believability of these personalities"
2,light entertainment,"I finished this book last night after a one-day read. Not bad. The characters kept me interested. Especially enjoyed Eleanor, the mother. Felt that she was a believable and sad left-behind housewife. What I did have a hard time believing was the age of the main character. She seemed to have a lot of wisdom for a late-20's young mother. I can't imagine a grad student at that age being so introspective about marriage. She actually figured out that if you give marriage a chance and can get over the immature stumbling blocks of the early years, it may actually turn out well. It usually takes an empty-nester to realize that! Overall, it was entertaining."
2,Outstanding product at extraordinary price,"If you're just looking for a drive that will play DVD's, then this one is for you. Don't hesitate to pick this up."
2,Who is BENQ,"Benq is the new company, formally from Acer digital products... So they not new and been around for some time."
2,What do you mean you don't have an olive canoe in your cupboard?!,"This is a well made, surprisingly large, quality little olive boat. I had no intention of using it for actual olives--rather I placed turtle green marbles in it and sat it on my bookshelf as a whimsy piece--but for anyone intending to actually serve olives to their guests, this would perfectly do the trick. But it has many nore uses too! Mount on the wall under a beautiful, stark dried flower arrangement, use it for your child's craft project to sort thru tiny pieces...the list goes on and on. It's generously carved out, so any item not taller than two inches--we're talking some mega stuffed olives here--should fit nicely. The wood isn't too dark, too liight, or splintery in any way. Looks just as represented here!"
2,Nice action.,"Nice action with the optional ""Tan spring"". Easy to install and bang for the buck!! Good buy to your Can-Am 800."
2,"Beautiful, Haunting...Historically Accurate...?","I loved the movie, I loved the soundtrack. I had several songs on repeat. Then I read the book and found that Charles Frazier had set the town of Cold Mountain right where I was born. One of my favorite songs on the soundtrack was ""I'm Going Home"". I've tried to research it, to find out who wrote it originally, but I've come up with nothing. If anyone could help me out here, I'd greatly appreciate it."
2,Im buying Havaianas from now on!,I've only had these for a day and I love them already. I haven't really got to wear them alot so I dont know about the durability or if the dont get dirty. But I can vouch for how comfortable they are. You will not regret buying these.
2,Very good expansion to great game,"If you enjoy Civ 4 you will love the improvements the expansion disk brings. More civs, more leaders and traits, new great person addition, new units and new scenarios. The games AI has also been very much improved with the newest patch for the expansion disk.The addition of new traits for leaders and realigning the previous leaders traits with the new has really improved the leader choices and strategies of the original game.The new scenarios are all very good. Especially the challenging Chinese Unification and Genghis Khan scenarios."
2,Think on it . . . Good Reading that Feeds the Soul,How often we go through life and neglect to understand the life lessons in everyday living. Grace Livingston Hill presents such occurrences in her writings. The rather slow pace is a welcomed element as the reader is drawn into each chapter. If only the world could recognize the difficult hurdles in life without becoming violent . . . Grace Livingston Hill brings forth such situations.
2,Fred Everything - From The Deep Remixes 1998-2001,"As good as Fred Everything's Under the Sun was, From the Deep, a collection of his remixes, is better. Why? Fred's ability to take a track, find the essential elements, and rearrange them into house-flavored jams is amazing. He transforms the punk/hip-hop ""Astounded"" by Bran Van 3000 into a deep journey. The plaintive vocals on Random Factor's ""Without You"" are given a new insistent quality by his touch, and the Northern Light Orchestra's ""Loverboy"" becomes even more romantic. It's much easier to mess up a remix of a good than of a bad song, and although his mix of Jaffa's ""Elevator"" isn't too exciting, his retakes of ""It's Complete"" by Atjazz or ""Watch Them Come"" by Roy Davis, Jr. redeem him. Some of the tracks may lag at the end, but that's because they were designed for mixing, rather than listening. It's a compliment to Fred Everything that the tracks work just as well as listening material."
2,Everything,"Montreal Deep House Don Fred Blais aka Fred Everything, complies in this album his best remixes ..A Must-buy for every house dan"
2,Where are the good ol' days when we could burn books?,"Quite frankly, this book is wasted on a culture that celebrates Oprah, ""Friends,"" and everything Bruckheimer. It's too good of a book to be put in the same strip malls that cough up today's entertainment and it knows it.The dialogue is fierce, the characters are sharp, and the narration is spot on. Oh, and it's funny as hell. That explains, of course, why you've never heard of it.Were there any justice, this book would be required reading. It could serve as the litmus test for some sort of bare-minimum competency test where if you dare said ""I don't get it"" more than twice, or didn't laugh at least once per page, they would strip you of voting rights, citizenship, and dignity. But, no. Instead those are the people who head corporations, reguarly attend focus groups, and wind up featured in the latest edition of People.Oh well.It's a good book."
2,Too much Zeds?,"I loved this book - recomended by my good buddy Tavernello, p.s. thank you Tave - but i don't know if the Z-words filrouge was really necessary. The novel is fine and the idea of robbing bank as a philosofical statement is really awsome.Much better than other, more sold & rated, books, but still not deservin' the fifth star.Post Ps: Tibor, if you read this rewiew, please forgive and e-mail me, becouse i got some question for you, Thanks SZ"
2,Absolutely perfect!,"A friend recommended this book to me along with the assurance that I would have the time of my life...now I'm passing the advice along to you! Don't delay! Pick up your copy and begin the ""zaniest"" journey you've ever been on! You won't regret it, I promise, and you'll thank me later..."
2,Review of 747: Creating the World's First Jumbo Jet.....,"This is a great book about the best airliner ever built-The Boeing 747. The book details the epic task of designing, building and putting this magnificent machine into service. The fact that the Boeing 747 is still in service 40 years later is testiment to the soundness of the original design, by the author of this book, Joseph Sutter."
2,COLOR EXPECTED,The picture shows white plastic coaster which is what I wanted. Ordered 3 sets. One came white and two came blue. Disappointed all were not white as pictured.
2,...or how to navigate your dream,"This book is an inspiring, informational and well written account of how Joe Sutter's dream came to be. An excellent read for anyone interested in aviation, commercial aircraft, management and start-up growth. While his was focused on aviation and the birthing pains of the 747, it is analogous to many of our own dreams and trials as we strive to do what we 'know' in our gut to be our contribution to our businesses, organizations, or environment. His lessons in leadership, perseverance and a healthy dose of 'independence of thought' are great reminders not to follow the crowd, but carve your own path through them. Joe sounds a little arrogant at times, which you can easily ignore. He does give plenty of credit to legion members of the team, including those he didn't particularly get along with. An excellent read."
2,Easy & recommended read for young engineers,"The anecdotal engineering verses political battles, with some good examples on how to succeed as an engineer makes it worth your time. I found myself laughing at the similarities I encountered in my national defense career (thirty years later). The book is a mix of Boeing aircraft development history, mostly focused on the 747 series, with a frequent asides into Sutter's feelings about his family, friends/colleagues, customers, celebrities, vendors, and superiors. That was not what I expected, but there is value there -- especially for newly minted geek engineers who may have a low E.Q."
2,"Candyman, Candyman, Candyman, Candyman...Candy...","This movie was great! Tony Todd as ""Candyman"" is terrifying. I swear, after doing this movie so well, he had no other option but to play spooky roles. I dare you to say it five times..."
2,Clive at his best,another truly great horror flick inspired by the greatest Clive Barkertired of all these lame teenage slasher flicks that dont scarethen get this moviefor that matter get all Clive's moviesthey will change your view of horror
2,Overall a Pretty Good Film,"This movie stands out for its on-location depiction of inner-city Chicago. It is an urban Chicago movie which gives you a real flavor of Chicago. To make matters more intersting it deals with the notorious Cabrini-Green housing projects too, with great authenticity. It deals with inner-city Blacks in a frank and believable manner. The story line is pretty strong and the performances are good. A good B movie over all, a low budget gritty true-to-life movie that will only get better with time. Oh, and it is creepy and scary too."
2,BRILLIANT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Candyman is perhaps the best horror movie ever made, it is brilliant, at first i was not that bothered about it, but when i watched it the second time, it really opened my eyes!!!!This film will nit let you down, buy it for your own good!!!!"
2,A truely frightening masterpiece,This is one of those movies that can stand alone in the Horror world. The tale of a son of a slave brutally murdered because he loved a white woman and he returns from the grave to extract revenge is pretty cool.The story itself revolves around a woman researching the myth for school. She doesn't believe in it despite the fact that many people tell her it's true. So she decides to chant his name 5x and from there her world spirals into a path of destruction and chaos.What's cool is how effective Tony Todd plays the candyman. YOu almost feel sympathy for him but then he guts someone and you groan.HTis is a very cool movie that is a must see.
2,Seattle Uses Rubber Posts fro Center Dividers,"This is a story about Joe. The story about Bob Haage begins here but moves to Long Beach according to the text. I can only look at Joe from 3855 Lakewood in Long Beach at first, but later I flew on a United 747. Gosh, compared to the Convair 340 with a malfuncioning generator buss I began on the leap is enormous. I had to go back and read about early jet airliners to complete this shift."
2,As terrific as slasher movies come.,"Virginia Madsen is Helen Lyle, a grad student studying the Candyman urban legend, where if you state his name five times in front of a mirror, he'll come and slash you from the groin up. Initially, she laughs it off as superstition until she encounters the Candyman himself...or has she? Scary and stylish horror film based off Clive Barker's short story mixes psychological and visceral thrills into one deft and extremely well-made blend. Bernard Rose's superb direction and script make this one of the most frightening films ever made. Great performances from the lovely Madsen and Tony Todd as the titular character. Sorry, Hellraiser fans, but this is THE definitive Clive Barker adaptation.**** 1/2 out of *****"
2,Unbelievable!! best speakers ever no others can compare!!!,Crazy. Just got them in the mail and hooked them up to my ipod in minutes. Highly recommend for the price you pay. Very clear no static and easy hook up. i search everywhere for a great price and i found it here. Go really well with the apple products got the nice look to it and to top it off the blue lights on the bottom are sick. Very small take up not even half the space of my old stereo. Buy them and you'll love them. DONT BUY THEM AND YOU'LL REGRET IT.
2,Joining the chorus,"I've recently got into to the iTunes thing, and it became pretty apparent to me that my computer speakers aren't going to cut it. I spent some time looking around for a set of reasonably priced set, and when I saw the price here on Amazon[.com] (I saw this set go for 120s in most places) I decided to buy it. Anyway, WOW. Really fantastic sound. It's hard to believe such great sound comes from this small compact set. Plan on having the whole thing on your desk though, in order to get easy access to the controls on the subwoofer and speakers. It's not a big deal, I have a REALLY cluttered desk, and I found that they really don't take up much space."
2,MS Trackball Explorer Compatible,"I expected trouble with 5 mouse buttons, but this tiny switch works like a charm."
2,Rock Solid!,"I went through two other mini kvm switches, both junk, before getting this excellent unit. It has worked flawlessly for me for over two months. Never fails to switch between computers, doesn't care which computer boots first, works even when one of the computers is down. I highly recommend this product."
2,Works with caution,"My IOGEAR KVM (GCS62) works great once in the proper configuration; however, with all the new systems out there, it's tough to get all PS2 connectors and I found that the switch does not work well trying to convert PS2 to USB - net, it has limited lifetime..."
2,Best Way to Use Old Computer,"I got this for my husband. He had a computer that was running Windows ME that all his computer flight simulators were installed on, but was having difficulties with stability. Last year I purchased a new computer for him with Windows XP. He loves his new computer but most of his games did not run correctly (many were created during the height of the Windows 98 phase). He recalled at a former job that the KVM Switch helped his company re-furbish older computers for re-sell. After much discussion, I decided to purchase this for him and resurrect the old computer. It arrived ready to install out of the box and without difficulty. Needless to say, he's very happy that he can use all his games completely again!"
2,Micro KVM Switch,I have now used this switch for about 2 weeks and enjoy the ease with which I can switch between to computers. One of the ports is connected to a laptop which has had a slight bug. The mouse stops working if I do not keep it moving during startup. Once Windows is fully up I do not have any problems. This bug does not impact my desktop so I attribute it more to the Laptop than I do to the KVM switch. All in all I would say this is a very good 2 port KVM switch.
2,IOGEAR GCS62 MiniView Micro KVM Switch,Very easy to set-up. No problem with the audio that other reviews mentioned. I would highly recommend it.
2,"Excellent speakers, just one thing I'd change","The sound is fantastic, actually it beats my home stereo by a mile. The one thing I'd change on them is to have included a headphone jack on one of the satelite speakers. Otherwise, they're worth the price, your ears will thank you!"
2,Very Easy To Use,"The IOGEAR GCS62 MiniView Micro KVM Switch was very easy to setup and use. The hotswap quick key uses the Scroll Lock key, which for most people is a wasted key anyway, so I think that is great! All in all, a very good product at a great price, would recommend for others to buy."
2,A use for the Scroll Key at last! 2 Taps and it switches,"Like I wrote in the title: A use for the Scroll Key at last! 2 Taps and it switches. That is all there is to learn after you plug in the cables that are part of this KVM switch. Boot up both PCs and just tap the Scroll key twice to instantly switch among your 2 PCs. IOGear has a winner in this 2 PC jewel!While I was on-line with one PC (with my modem,) I can tap to the other PC, get a file, make a pdf, edit a document, view an mpg, whatever, and then just tap twice and I am back to the first PC that has not lost its internet connection.Stop reading and just order one ! It works ! !"
2,"Little speakers, Big sound","I am extremely pleased with the purchase of this speaker set. For such a small system, the sound quality is intense! While sound was the most sought after element, I wanted something that looked great sitting next to my iBook. I've always been turned off by equipment that was cumbersome and preferred something that was aesthetically pleasing. The controls for the bass, treble, and volume are located in convenient positions and do not detract from its smooth appearance. Within 5 minutes, my new sound system was up and running. If you want a cool looking speaker set with great sound, there's no need to look any further than the JBL Creature!"
2,Great Looks AND Sound!,"I think these are the best looking speakers out there. The coolest part may be the blue lights underneath the left and right speakers. They really do look like spaceships. The sound is fantastic, especially considering the small size of the whole system. The subwoofer is not as large and bulky as other systems in this price range and it's probably the only subwoofer you wouldn't want to hide anyway - cause it looks cool! Would have been even better if it too had blue lights. The only downside I can think of is that there's only one input jack. So you can't hook up multiple sources directly to the system. I've tried mini-phone Y adaptors but the sound becomes distorted."
2,Very Good Sounding Speakers,"JBL did a great job. Easy to assemble, light weight, nice to look at, and most of all the sound is amazing for speakers that size. I would have prefered a better design for the volume control. You hear a slight ficker sound when you lower or raise the volume. A dail type has better contol. But, overall I intend to keep my Silver Creatures for a long time."
2,"Great design, great sound, great price","I spent almost all of my time with these speakers at the Apple Store during my first ever visit to the place!I echo the same positive feedback that the earlier reviewers have given. This is the purest sound I have ever heard from a speaker set of this size and budget. Aesthetically, trendy looking white Creature is goes very well with other white creatures like the iMac, iBook, and iPod. An excellent choice for desktop speakers. Combine them with the iPod and you don't need any other music system in the house.The interface is very simple and the bass range is very excellent and beats many of the bigger speaker systems. Really worth the price. Recommended even for audiophiles."
2,Happy,All around WOW! Don't have the cash for the HK soundsticks? You will definitely love these. Great Sound. Get them.
2,A great product at any price.,"Installs in minutes with no loss of resolution in the monitor at an affordable price. I also love being able to switch between computers by pressing a button on my keyboard rather than messing with the switch itself. Also, the 12ft of cable was long enough for my needs. I couldn't ask for much more. I'm very pleased with this purchase."
2,Very Good Chiller,"One of the best horror movies of my time. The story is so good for a subject that seems like it could make a bad movie. The acting is top-notch and I would really like to see Virginia Madsen in another role (she had cameos in ""The Rainmaker"" and ""The Haunting""). Very scary movie every time you watch it. Watch it at night, it will give you a better chill. The sequal was okay, but it contradicted almost everything that happened in this one. I heard they made a third one on HBO, but I have not seen it. Rent this at your own risk."
2,CANDYMAN,"CANDYMAN is a horror film about a college student named Helen who is doing research on urban legends. Helen decides to write a paper about 'Candyman' - a killer with a hook for a hand who will appear behind you when you say his name three times in front of a mirror and split your body in half with his hook. Helen decides to see if Candyman is real or if he's just a legend, so she says his name three times in front of a mirror...and soon, she discovers that Candyman is very real! This film literally scared me the first time I saw it because it's very suspensful and intense. The film is based on a short story written by horror author Clive Barker."
2,Excellent horror.,"Eerie, effective horror with a very original script written by the master of horror Clive Barker. Helen Lyle (Virginia Madsen) is eager to do research on her project on serial killers. Many serial killers have been caught, but the mystery of one remains unclosed. Candyman, when his name is mentioned five times in front of a mirror is supposedly meant to come to the person and slay them. Helen is determined to discover if this ""myth"" is real. Most recently someone is brutally murdered, but is this the responsibiltiy of Candyman or is it something else? Tense, psychological horror thriller. Tony Todd plays the evil Candyman with excellence. Just one note before I go. Whatever you do when you finish watching this film don't take the chance saying his name five times in the mirror. I know I didn't!"
2,So You Want To Be A Dog Trainer by Nicole Wilde,I truly enjoyed this book. It is very well written and an easy read. Although very detailed.If your just thinking about this field or even just getting started I feel this book would be of great value.Nicole has shared many helpfull ideas and really puts things in perspective as to just what exactly the dog training field is all about.If you are having trouble with self confidence about getting going this book will give you the boost you need.Truly an enjoyable book.
2,Required Reading for People Considering Dog Training as a Career,"This book was helpful in the sense that it puts all of the considerations in black and white. If you think you have thought of everything, I'll bet you find something in this book that may have slipped your mind.I like Nicole's matter-of-fact approach. Her writing style makes this book an easy read."
2,"""So You Want To Be A Dog Trainer""","Nicole Wilde's sense of humor and common sense approach shines in all of her books. ""So You Want To Be A Dog Trainer"" is packed full of great ideas and suggestions. It is a ""must read"" for new dog trainers."
2,MUST READ for ALL DOG TRAINERS (current and aspiring) !,"All dog trainers (current and aspiring) will benefit from SO YOU WANT TO BE A DOG TRAINER by Nicole Wilde!Nicole writes in a personal, engaging manner, speaking directly to the reader.This book is comprehensive and clear. If you are a dog trainer or want to be a dog trainer, buy and read this book now.As an experienced positive dog trainer and the author of Positive Puppy Training Works and Labrador Retrievers for Dummies, I give this book my highest recommendation."
2,Excellant resource for parents who love their children,"The Babywise series by Mr Ezzo and Dr Bucknam is the BEST parenting series I have ever read. Our 2 daughters (2.5 years old, adopted as an infant and 6 months) thrive on the common sense, practical advice in this book. Both slept comfortably through the night by 8 weeks. Many people have commented that we are ""so lucky"" to have such happy, content and healthy children...it's not luck, it's the awesome and loving parenting skills learned from reading Babywise books! I can only assume the ""one star"" reviewers are just anti-Christian, anti-common sense folk who didn't actually read the books. Shame on them for giving false reviews of this exceptional series. Please read for yourself, you and your baby will be happy you did!"
2,This book changed my life,This book showed the reader the real side of today's leading girl groups and girl singers. It's an extrodanary look at the female side of rock. I loved it and hope to find books just like it in the future.
2,Look no further - this is the book for you!,"This certainly is the book for me. I'm in the process of becoming a dog trainer and this book was my first step. It is an easy read and is packed with information, step-by-step guidance and resources - not to mention humor sprinkled in. It seems to me that she covers it all - even considering your own comfort zone. Nicole Wilde writes directly to you in a friendly one-on-one style. I very much appreciate her gentle approach to training - we owe that to our loyal friends, and I'm so pleased that she shares this in her book. Even after I do become a dog trainer, I'm certain I will refer to this book throughout my career."
2,French Chanson directly from your preconceptions,"I don't know a thing about this performer. We learned his ""un jour tu verras"" in French class and then I bought a CDs of his in Paris. He has the funniest, most french voice you ever heard and the whole ""allure"" of the music is so authentic. It realy gives you the mood of one of those ancinet french films you never saw. A girl deserted by her lover from the resistance, gives him over to the SS and go ... ... in the Seine. Something like that."
2,VMPL2B,"This mounting system was easy to install and all of the necessary hardware was provided. Very satisfied with all aspects of this purchase (quality, delivery, value, etc...)."
2,"Easy to install, can't beat the Amazon price!!",My dad and I installed it in just an hour! It was very. You can't beat this price. I found the same mount at Best Buy for over $200!!!
2,"Easy to install, great product!","I bought this based on the other reviews, and I was pleased with the results. I installed my 42"" Panasonic plasma without any trouble - easy instructions and simply assembly. Definitely recommend this product - especially for the price I paid for it compared to other mounting kits I saw advertised elsewhere for closer to $250."
2,Excellent crop circle book,Steve and Karen Alexander have done an excellent job in this book explaining the many aspects of the mysterious phenomenon of crop circles that appear every summer in southern England. The book is beautifully illustrated with aerial photos of the crop circle formations in all their majesty. A must read for all crop circle enthusiasts as well as any newcomers to this phenomenon.Adrian De Santis
2,Brew Kettle Perfection,Great large stainless steel kettle for home brewing. Large enough to boil all 5 gallons. heavy pot and great quality
2,Highly recommend,"Good music, good band. Got to see them live back in '04 when I lived in Maryland.Haven't listened to CD for awhile and tonight it brought back good memories of that band!"
2,I *had* to have it!,"I got Platform 9 and 3/4 for my birthday (as well as the Hogwarts) and it's totally one of my favorites! Did I mention I'm 14? I love the barrier that gets you into it. And where you can keep the luggage. I had to have it! I love the sweets trolley, and even though I already had Harry and Ron, I also loved them. I'm not sure this is 'educational' but you can always teach your children the noise a train makes *Choochoo* Hehe. I really think 'you' whoever 'you' is should get it.-Harry Potter Extremist"
2,A super guide,"It's an awesome book,it contains a hundred tips for any person who want to be a profesional dog trainer...very helpfull"
2,Dog Trainer... Yes I do,"Nicole explains very clearly all what you have to consider when you are trying to endeavor in dog training, considering not only dogs but also the owners of the dogs. Also Nicole provides very good tips about this wonderful dog world. I strongly recommend that every person trying to be a dog trainer should read this book for general information. This book does not tell you about training techniques. Just general info that you should consider."
2,A great video to start doing Yoga by,"I bought this video over 15 months ago to get started doing yoga, but even now, after buying several more videos, it is still one of my favorites. Eva Marie Pilapuf takes you through an hour of various warm up exercises and yoga poses. So many introductory Yoga vidoes are so challenging that they discourage prospective practitioners. Most people using this video, however, will not get outside their comfort zones doing these poses, but after the workout they will feel good about themselves from the activity and their accomplishments. Isn't that what Yoga should be all about?"
2,really good and scary!,"now that i have seen this movie,i havent been able to look straight at a mirror for five seconds i was so freaked out.i saw this when i was 6 years old and it didnt scare me and i thought candyman was weak.then i just saw it last year and im still scared. but really good horror film though.this is much better than the short story that Clive Barker write, ""the forbidden"".Tony Todd's voice just freaked me out totally when he is talking about ""be my victim"" and then the camera goes down to his jacked up hook.or when he's saying ""what is blood if not for sheding"" and talks about all this violent stuff.totally freaky."
2,Awesome :-),"Growing up, this film always spooked me. So I'm happy that Amazon was able to allow me to re-see it. An it showed up so well."
2,It will freak you out!,"A decent horror movie, to be honest. Not a masterpiece or a huge blockbuster, but the film succeeds in fulfilling whatever it promises. Virginia Madsen and Tony Todd steal the show quite easily with their remarkable performances and a decent, class direction makes the film worth a watch."
2,"Candyman, candyman, candyman, candyman....","I like this Horror classic. Starring Tony Todd who i am a fan of. 2 other sexy actresses i like in this film Virgina Madsen and Kasi Lemmons. I really like music made by Philip Glass. Great and scary + atmospheric. Yes, Tony Todd is really great playing Candyman in my opinion.Picture quality: 4/5No reference quality, but it sure does look nicer than the DVDs. Some nice colours, details.Audio quality: 4/5The English audio which is in DTS-HD Master Audio 2.0 Dolby Stereo, i must say it sounds pretty good. Some good stereo effects and DEEP bass when Tony Todd speaks. The music actually benefits from this lossless audio and sounds improved.Film: 4.5/5Overall: 4/5candyman."
2,COME WITH ME!,"WHen this film was release nationwide , I went to the theaters for a look back in the early 90's, I remember my experience watching it on the big screen, my friends and I got dizzy, it certainly hypnotized us. Fun, Freaky Film, watch it on a big screen t.v. in the dark, if you dont watch this frequently , you'll get some kicks out of it."
2,The Candyman CAN!,"I'm not a big fan of cut-em-up horror movies. Usually I find them laughable and low-brow. Candyman, however, was a HUGE surprise! Sure, it's a gorey horror movie, but it's also a psychological thriller and yes, even a love story. I will have to say, on top of all that, it's also up there with one of the most frightening movies I've ever seen. A great movie to watch, and a great movie to think about later. Definitely worth owning and re-watching, you'll notice more symbolism, allegory, etc in it the more you watch it."
2,"Candyman, Candyman..............","Candyman is a creepy and very scary horror movie. The first time i saw this i think i was like 11 maybe at a slumber party, i was so scared. Watching it again recently and i didnt find it as scary, but i thought it was very clever and a really decent film. Helen Lyle is a writer working on a story about the Candyman, an urban legend in which if you say the name Candyman into the mirror five times, the Candyman comes to get you. So Helen goes about to prove that the urban legend isnt true and says Candyman five times in the mirror. Soon she is being stalked by the Candyman and she will live to regret her actions. Both Helen (played by Virgina Madsen I think?) and the Candyman (Tony Todd) are portrayed superbly. I also absolutley love the score by Phillip Glass, the music is so perfect for the movie and its also very creepy, yet cool. Anyway check this out all you horror fans."
2,Better than expected!,This movie turned out to be more involving and structured than I expected. It tends to drag in the middle but it's complexity increases as the plot moves along. Overall: PRETTY GOOD!
2,"Candyman, Candyman, Candyman, Candyman...Candyman","Do you dare say the name five times?Helen Lyle did. Helen, (Virginia Madsen) is doing a thesis on Urban Legends with her friend Bernadette. Their favorite is that of Candyman.If you say his name 5 times in the mirror, he appears behind you and guts you from groin to gullet.The two investigate in an area of Chicago called Cabrini-Green, where a woman was killed and a boy castrated. Helen doesn't believe the rumours, until HE appears. Candyman.Her life begins to crumple around her as she's accused of 1st degree murder and kidnapping, and her husband reveals a devastating secret.Candyman is by far the best horror movie I've seen since Texas Chainsaw Massacre.There is gore, but not the kind that makes you gag. Its semi-subtle.Plus, acting from Madsen and Candyman Tony Todd is far above average.And the ending is fantastic. Gosh, I saw it a mile away but it still scared the crapper out of me."
2,Shrinks by nearly half,"See where the product features say this Measures ""10 by 9 1/2 by 3 inches (l x w x h,"" and in the Product Details, the Product Dimensions are: ""5.1 x 4.4 x 2.1 inches ; 2 pounds?""They might have shipped the 10 inch clock, but I got the 5.1 inch version by the time it arrived. It works great, though. And I learned that ""Features"" aren't ""Details"" and to read more carefully.Still, it's a good clock, sychronizes perfectly, and its temperature readings are accurate."
2,Mini-wheats worth eating,I have found the Cinnamon Streusel Mini wheats to be an invigorating change to the normal breakfast cereal. A good product that is recommended by my taste buds
2,Unforgettable,"I feel like I've been asleep to the sufferings of my brothers and sisters in Tanzania. It depicts the horrible living conditions of hard working individuals, due to a number of circumstances beyond their control. The documentary is well done mind you, but it's raw and methodical in it's examination of the facts and unflinching in it's stare. A must see."
2,Amusing Short Stories,"A collection of clever short stories posed as reminiscences by Inne's intellectual detective, John Appleby. A number of the stories are very short, which is nice if one just wants to read for a few minutes and be satisfied."
2,Great place to start,"I bought this for my husband, because the usual beginner tapes/dvds were too advanced for him. He actually went through the entire time, and said he felt better afterwards. Any other dvd, he would have only lasted about 10 minutes.Then... I became sick, and didn't practice yoga for almost two months. This was a terrific practice for me, to get back into the swing of things. Not too hard, but a good stretch and flexibility session."
2,Excellent for special needs,I got this one for my grandmother who has never exercised since her teens. She is now doing some portion of this every day and loving it!Evamarie has a very pleasant presence that my grandmother just loves too.I would recommend this for any elderly individual or anyone that needs to take it very easy for whatever reason.
2,Amazing bang for the buck,"I bought this to replace a pretty expensive Belkin KVM switch that had always been a bit finicky - inserting keyboard and mouse input when switching causing odd behavior in the controlled PCs. I have been using the IOGEAR switch for over 3 months now with no problems. It switches perfectly, produces practically no video shadowing (running at 1240x1024x32), and perfectly emmulates the presence of a keyboard and mouse when a machine boots up with the switch set to the other PC. The Belkin couldn't do this correctly. Add to all this the fact that you don't need to buy extra cables (they are built into the switch) and it's a no-brainer. Great product, great price, works just like it should."
2,excellent blades,"These are excellent blades for cutting automotive exhaust tubing. I have tried many other brands and types, but these seem to work the best."
2,Great KVM switch,"I've been using the IOGEAR GCS62 for about a month now. I wanted a KVM switch to conserve desk space while using my old PC and a brand new Dell Dimension PC, . It was a breeze to install, pretty much foolproof and compact in design. Easy toggling between the 2 computers with a simple double keystroke on the seldom used ""scroll lock"" key.I don't do any intense, fast-paced gaming. I have used it on a flight simulator game and for simple typing, even at my quickest and it works flawlessly. I can't tell any difference between connecting the keyboard and mouse through the switch or directly to the PC.I'd highly recommend it."
2,Excellent choice,"If what you want is to use two cpu with 1 monitor, mouse and keyboard, this is the best choice. It have no problem with the video, a simple and confortable way to switch between the two cpu's and a nice look."
2,Remenisce with the King of Pop!!,"A great collection of some of Michael's most famous work (Thriller, Smooth Criminal) as well as videos we've rarely seen (Liberian Girl, Earth Song, etc.). This disc makes you remeber why he is one of the greatest entertainers of this century.Two Highlights of this disc are: 1)Michael's 1995 MTV Awards performance. It's probably his single best performance of his career. 15 minutes of singing and dancing to five or six of his past hits and finishing off with ""You Are Not Alone"" in front of a choir. 2)A Special feature that allows you to read the lyrics of the song as you watch the videos.The only negative is the fact that you have to flip the disc over. For some reason it's on two sides. Other than that, Enjoy!"
2,Perfect DVD Set,Purchased both of the History Films. If you are looking for a perfect collection of MJ's most popular videos. These DVD's will be the perfect collection. It inlcudes the full length version of his exteneded videos (which is something many other's don't). So if you are looking for a DVD collection of his best video's this would be the one. 5 thumbs up!!!!!!
2,mswilliams2004,I loved this dvd!I hope that there will be an anthology realeased with all MJs video. I want them all! Even though this dvd has a few of the same videos as history vol 1 its still a great buy. There are several other videos to enjoy! I've purchased all the MJ dvds I could find on amazon. My favorite is the Dangerous Tour as well as the Dangerous on film!!! Enjoy.
2,Michael Jackson Review,"This extraordinary video compliation of Michael's work is truly brilliant! I watch it quite often and am always deeply mesmerized and moved to tears. Michael, (God Bless him) is truly the most brilliantly gifted, sensitive, compassionate, electrifying souls to ever grace this planet. I wish, (with all my heart) that he was still here."
2,Works Well,"A couple of months ago, I ordered this product. I like having two pockets. The organizer sticks to the trunk's carpet and nothing tips over. I bought a second one for my husband to use. It works well."
2,Fitted for my FIT,"This item is a wonderful accessory to accommodate the space restrictions of my HONDA Fit. The walls are great, finally my bottled drinks cannot roll all over the place and/or misshapen the carrier. I have another soft trunk organizer that zips up it's not good at all, never keeps it's shape but this one has plastic walls which supports items upright, plus it has velcro corners to keep bag from travelling throughtout your trunk. Folds up neatly and conveniently flat, not heavy, it even has handles to transport easily with items inside. I'm seriously considering buying another. Kudos to Case Logic for developing a smart accessory."
2,THE GREATEST ENTERTAINER IN THE WORLD>>>,This is a great DVD. Mr. Jackson is one of the greatest entertainers in the world. This just shows it to those who do not believe.
2,chill... put it on repeat,"I went out on a limb buying this cd.... yeah, 10 bucks for a 4 song cd was a risk,(especially since i never heard any of the songs from this album) but i wasn't dissapointed. ""Move"" consists of well produced jazz/funk instrumentals, and diverse's delivery smooths out well with 'em. Don't expect anything too prophetic from this guy, but he is pleasing to hear... the only downside to this, was this cd was way too short. 4 songs plus a clean verion of the first track, didn't really cut it for me. But the first time i heard it, i was pleased....so don't sleep on this one (if your willing to pay up....)"
2,The best video for beginners!,"This video has simple instructions and poses for any beginner. I found the Yoga video every helpful for people unfamilar with the Yoga practice. It discusses how Yoga works the body and the mind without being flowerly. The poses are so basic and comfortable, that any beginner can use this video to gain strength without feeling like a pretzel."
2,Gadsby,"This book is totally worth reading if you're interested analysing in how he managed to write a novel without using the letter ""e"", but by god don't read it hoping for a good story - Wright was a terrible writer."
2,"""...And the time has finally come for me to pack my bags and walk away...""","The music of the Marshall Tucker Band brings neverending enjoyment to my ears. It's like the Metallica of Southern Rock: I just can't stop listening. Their first self-titled album is solid from beginning to end. ""Take the Highway"" and ""Can't You See,"" both being my personal favorites on the album, should be considered timeless classics in the Southern Rock genre. The other songs, including the 12-minute Everyday (I Have the Blues) recorded live, are extraordinarily well-written and well-played. To be honest, however, this is the first time I have ever stumbled across an album by the Marshall Tucker Band. And I don't think I'll stop right here. This is great music; it's certainly better than the mainstream music that we have today. Up next: the second CD called A New Life!Grade: 9.5/10"
2,Phenomenal,"The debut album from The Marshall Tucker Band is one of the greatest. This album brings out the sound that MTB does so well, from country, to rock, to blues, all rolled together into a southern sound. Doug Gray's vocals on ""Take the Highway"" are fantastic, Toy Caldwell's ""Can't You See"" remains a favorite, ""Hillbilly Band"" adds a bluegrass feel, ""Ramblin"" is full of energy, and the live ""Everyday (I Have the Blues)"", displaying how massively skilled Toy Caldwell was, is one of the greatest guitar songs I've ever heard. All in all, I highly recommend this album to every MTB fan along with fans of Southern Rock and Country rock."
2,cell phones,it is nice to be added to another line - I don't use that many minutes and i feel better being on another plan.
2,good coverage but Cingular style antics,"Cingular offers the best coverage in San Diego and probably southern California. We only used 350 of the 550 because most of our friends also have cingular (free m2m). After reviewing our bill we had over 3000 minutes combined or about 2cents a minute. The only cons i see are that 1) Cingular will be raising the sms from 10 to 15 cent. Total ripoff! 50% increase wow! 2) the first month you need to pay in advance. I at first did not understand, but I took a long look at the bill and talked to CS to clear everything up (when our service is over I will only be paying taxes and any additional chargess)."
2,A Masterpiece!,"Yoga Anytime Anyplace is beautifully done! It is unusual to find an exercise video that is as attentive to artistic detail as this one. Not only is it a complete routine that is revitalizing and refreshing to do but the use of rich colors and wonderful music interwoven throughout makes it fun to watch again and again. Ameeta Nanji is easy to follow; as her clear voice helps to still and focus the mind, she encourages the body to stretch a little bit further. As a Shiatsu practitioner I find this to be a good complement to my daily exercise program."
2,You Need to Check Out APRIL SIXTH!,I saw this band live in California and trust me -they are the best band I've ever seen perform! I bought this EP and I listen to it constantly! It's one you'll never tire of. Stop what you are doing and buy their EP.
2,He truly is the King of Pop!!,"This video collection re-proves his title. It contains some rather riveting videos, and some that are just plain cool. From the space adventure of ""Scream"" to the dramatic ""Earth Song"", the cassete has it all. A must have for fans!"
2,Great DVD,R.I.P. King of Pop and performer of the century! This DVD is great! I liked it so much I have given a couple away as gifts.
2,great carseat,"This carseat is so fantastic. We bought 2 of them, one for our toddler and one for our 5 month old. Both ages are great for this seat, it is comfortable and my husband says it is really simple to install. As well it was simple to adjust the harness for each of them. It is nicely padded, our daughter says it is very comfortable. I read some reviews that the reclining feature was nice for when their kids went to sleep but if you install it correctly the reclining feature is only to make it fit your car properly and for when it is rear facing, you have it in the recline position...which is nice for when they are asleep their heads are not flopped forward.we bought the seats directly from BabyAge because combined shipping was $7.highly recommend this seat!"
2,Are the videos full-length?,"I have never been able to find music videos when I want them. Are these the original, full-length versions or should I look elsewhere?"
2,THE King of Pop,"I think that Michael Jackson is the BEST! I haven't loved him that long.But I know all of songs from ABC to One More Chance.I been loveing him since 2001.Well, to get to the point Michael Jackson is the BEST of ALL TIME.It don't mata what people say Michael is the best.People can call him this or that but he is the KING......Thriller #1,Off The Wall #1,BAD#1,Dangerous#1,HIStory 2 #1's,BOTDF#1,Invincible #1,and I know Numbers Ones that is coming out is #1.So u can't say anything else cause I'm sticking 2 it.And nobody can say anything.........!!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,It is a great collection of some of Michael Jackson video's,I enjoyed the fact that I was able to see the MTV performance. The Earth song video is the best video I have ever seen.
2,Amazing,"I love this DVD. However, I wish they would have kept the ""brace youself"" at the beginning of the film instead of putting it at the end, lol :PAnd I wish they would have included the 2 Bad short film in there as well. Overall, I loved it. I always love watching MJ vids. I would definitely recommend it to any MJ fan."
2,Michael Jackson,This DVD was exaactly what I was looking for. It showed all the videos of the songs I am familiar with and some others I was not. The reveiews of some of the other videos lend me to think this is the one I wanted and they were right. Very good DVD for and MJ fan.
2,Michael Jackson History on Film,"This video covers a very good sample of his dancing and it is a great experience. Watch it, love it, keep it!"
2,Great for MJ fans,My son is a true MJ fan so he loves this. Its a collection of music videos of some of the best tunes that MJ ever made. Smooth Criminal is my all time favourite video. :)
2,"Michael Jackson - History on Film, Vol. 2","My son had purchased this video when it first released. He let me borrow it but, there is nothing like having your own copy. So I purchased a copy for myself. Watching it brings back memories of when the various videos had aired on television."
2,Michael Jackson History on Film Vol. 2,A MUST have for any Michael Jackson fan for sure!! Loaded with greatness. If you haven't seen this one you need to.
2,"""History on Film, vol.2"" is a good collection...","There are many good videos on this dvd, including ""Scream"" w/Janet Jackson, ""They Don't Really Care About Us"", the classics ""Thriller"" and ""Beat It"", and the underrated ""Blood on the Dance Floor""."
2,The Best Collection Of Music Videos Ever Compulated!,"Michael Has done it onece more, video after video he keeps getting better and better."
2,HIStory Vol 2,"Michael Jackson - History on Film, Vol. 2This is a beautiful tribute to a part of Michael Jackson's career. He hand picked each piece and made it for his fans to cherish. He took his God given gifts and fine tuned them into the magnificent King of Pop that will live forever as long as we continue to play his music and watch his videos. He captured our hearts because his own heart was bigger than any person I've ever had the pleasure of knowing. His music and dancing will live on forever as long as we listen to his songs and watch his short films. I don't want the world to forget this beautiful creature who took the basics of entertaining and catapulted them into the moves we've been attempting to copy for years. He was a wonderful Father, a Fabulous Entertainer and One of a kind; and he was my friend. I miss you Michael."
2,Fantastic complilations of Michael Jackson's short films,"I'm going to be honest. I got this video for one reason and one reason only. Although I can view it online, I HAD to have the EPIC Scream video so I could view it on my television. It is amazing quality, too. There are other favorites of mine on this video as well which is the best video or short film as Michael preferred to call them and that's Thriller. You will also get the video that skyrocketed Michael's career to another galaxy and that's the Billie Jean performance at the Motown 25: Yesterday, Today and Forever anniversary. The performance that the late legendary Fred Astaire who happened to be one of Michael's idols next to James Brown. It was also the performance that was enjoyed immensely by the late Marvin Gaye. This is a must have for every Michael Jackson film."
2,Best DVD that i have bought,"Since I am a Jackson fan for more than half of my life now (I am 21) and not only his music but also the man himself are very special to me, you could say that I am not exactly the ideal person to critic this dvd. But for those, who, just like me, love Michaels music and his performances with all their heart, this is the one dvd to have. And for those who don't like Michael's work but who are interested in seeing some of the best chartographed dance performances, this dvd is still worth its money. Finally, I hope that there will be a 3rd ""HisTory"" Video/DVD for there is surely a lot of material left, that isn't inclouded in ""History - Video Greatest Hits"" or ""HisTory on Video Vol. 2""."
2,WILL SERVE PURPOSE,THIS ITEM APPEARS THAT IT WILL SERVE IT'S PURPOSE WELL. WE HAVE NOT USED THE UNIT IN FOUL WEATHER AS OF YET BUT IT LOOKS GOOD
2,Multi-family Genealogical Gem,"I purchased this strictly for the discussion of the Bridgewater Leonard family of which I am a descendant. Like many of the family genealogies of this era (1928), there are no sources quoted, as required by serious, modern genealogists. It does, however, make for very interesting reading. The author goes on to discuss her other family lines including the Taunton Leonard family, the Aldens, etc. At the end she lists each family's genealogy as well as identifying royal lines that go way back into history."
2,one of DISNEYS best,"i first saw this when it came out, & thought it brilliant that is why i have bought it.of all disneys works next to this is Snow White, again i saw this when it first came out,& it is a pity they have not come(to me anyway) anywhere near making anything as good. the Living Desert I would say to anyone if u have not seen it, then you are missing a lot,not only for the music, but the antics as well."
2,Fantastic Book!,Not much more to add than has already been said. This book is great. If you are traveling to southern Utah - get it!
2,The best there is,"I already own the 1th Edition and used it extensively to find rare to be seen places in the Southwest. I am German and visit the Southwest once or twice a year and found this book to be invaluable. Easy to follow directions, great images, good advice. You don't need any other guide to see all the best places (which no one else finds)."
2,Tanner's back for another trek across Europe. A delight.,". Tanner is back in the third of eight books in the series. This one is much better than the first two. Again Tanner leaves NYC to trek across Europe, sneak across boarders. This time the trip takes him from home to Yugoslavia north to Russia. Keeping in mind this adventure as wells as the two others takes place before the brake up of the Soviet Union and the problems and war with the breakup of Yugoslavia. Block's historical accounts are excellent and add to the excitement of the book. It's well paced and I look forward to the others in the series. At this point in time they are on backorder at amazon.com."
2,My all-time favorite book!,"I just purchased this for a friend. I would have loaned her my copy, but I've loaned it out to so many people that I can't remember where it is anymore. Basically, a bear comes out of hibernation and finds a briefcase containing a manuscript and a necktie. He puts on the tie and takes the manuscript into town. Nobody seems to notice that he is a bear. Women think he is wonderful. In the meanwhile, the poor author of the manuscript is falling apart. This book is perfect for a time when you don't really want to think. Just relax and enjoy Hal Jam's journey."
2,what a pleasant surprise!,I picked up this book expecting a light flight-consuming read and was blown away by the simple but beautiful prose. the tale is too fanciful to sustain for 300 pages but that is a minor fault when compared to the author's imagination and masterful writing. I urge any curious reader or aspiring writer to read (and re-read and re-read) the second to last chapter; it features some of the best writing I've come across in years!
2,Funny and insightful,Ok this is one of the most satirical and funny books I have read in some time. The bear is great and I loved the illumination of the superficial world of publishing and book selling. You must read this book!
2,Fantastic Southwest,Book is an excellent source of information for our planned upcoming trip to Utah. Well worth the cost and I am ordering more books of the southwest area soon.
2,A Bargain,"For the price of one book you get the value of two booksand a movie. First, there is a very funny story. So, you getan entertaining novel. Second, it has so many examples ofthe gulf between ""what is said"" and ""what is heard"" that youalso get a text to use in marriage counseling or employeerelations. (It would brighten up both of those scenes.) Third,Kotzwinkle's language paints such vivid pictures that youthink you have already seen the movie."
2,What A Kick!! Makes you take a break!,"The book is a kick in the behind! You see people/characters in real life that would do exactly what the characters in the book are doing! This will not be appreciated by people caught up in the race, that don't know it! Better for the rest of us! Sit back, take a little break, and let your tummy do the excercising! (The laugh muscle's can never get built up enough!!By the By: bought the book, after borrowing it from the library"
2,"Great read, funny!","I was so gald to find this book again. I read it several years ago when my son let me borrow his copy. Then I lost it. I ordered two copies, one for me one for him. The books shipped to me in time for me to mail one to him for Christmas ( we live in different states). Both books are in Very good condition."
2,Wonderful satire and humor,"I read this book because there was a reference that it is thesame sub genre and similar kind of satire and humor as ""Rats on Strings""by Guy James. That reference was correct. And I enjoyed ""The Bear"" a lot -actually I read it already twice. Would recommend to anybody. Five stars."
2,Laugh out loud funny!,An incredible running gag sustained for 300 pages. Bizarre characters and keen insight into the human condition. I loved it
2,Fable for the Ages,"The characters are cliché, the plot is easy to follow but isn't that the point with a fable. Kotzwinkle takes something we know, or think we know, and twist it to show a window into our nature. This is an excellent book, that's insightful and very funny."
2,Homorous!!!!!!!!!,"This is a book I can read over again(at least once a year).It has much humor with a Bear striving to become human,whileat the same time the human is getting out into the outdoors with nature.So this novel has an interesting twist."
2,A Charming Story,"A charming book and genuinely funny to boot.It's impossible not to like Hal Jam, a true innocent abroad, as he makes his way through the shark infested world of publishing with absolutely no idea of what's going on.This book is also the source of a long standing arguement between my brother and me, he read this book and insisted Hal was a real bear. I said otherwise. Reading the other reviews I'm not so sure now."
2,Fabulous book for photographers,"This was a very helpful book. It gave suggestions on where and when to go for spectacular photographs. The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is that there wasn't enough information. I went to Zion National Park and there were only a few pages on photographing the park. After 2 days in the park, I found many other spectacular things and places to photograph which would have been nice to be included in the book."
2,"Southwest ....Zion, Bryce","Great informative book for planning travel to Zion, Bryce Canyon and surrounding areas. It is a definite ""must have"" for every photographer traveling in the area."
2,Outstanding Resource,"Our family had planned for 7 days in southern Utah and we were having difficulty deciding on the many options available. Many of the guide books and hiking guides did not provide the information we were looking for - out of the way photography locations. This book is a fantastic resource for those individuals looking for sites with incredible viewing possibilities, many of which are not well published. The author also provides tables outlining road conditions so one can plan a visit based on their vehicle capability. The only thing missing from the book is a formula for controlling the weather to improve your photographs. This book became our primary planning and resource tool and provided photography opportunities we would have otherwise missed using our other planning guides. Thank You!"
2,"LAMENT FOR A MAKER is complex, challenging, absolutely fascinating!","Michael Innes has written many mysteries, all of them worth reading. LAMENT FOR A MAKER is an absolute classic! This is a book I will read over and over!"
2,Enjoyable Read,I really enjoyed the characters in this book and the storyline was great. I would recommend this to anyone who has enjoyed the Archane books in the past this one doesn't let you down.
2,Best villian ever,is the 'Killer Diva'. I just loved her. I don't know how she came up with her but I thought she was fabulous. I liked the main characters also - I thought they were pitched just right. Enough character / 'tough life' stories to make them interesting but not so over the top they were unbelievable. Of course you have to buy into the whole Arcane Society thing but if you can it all works. I would like to see at least one main character who is not an off the chart talent though. One thing I appreciated about Running Hot was the minimal fill-in stuff about the Arcane Society. I've read all the other ones and was glad to see I didn't have to wade through a lot of repetitive explanations.
2,Visual and Musical Masterpiece,"I have watched other musical DVDs in the past but, this DVD was so captivating. The visual sets and the musical compositions are outstanding. Carmen has such great presence and great vocal artistry. The supporting musicians are fantastic and work very well together. The only thing that could have been better was to have attended the live concert in 02/05. Luckily, with this DVD, we can relive those moments. There should be an award for best musical DVD, I am sure that this one would win ""Hands-Down""."
2,Fantastic Package.,"This a great concert DVD. Carmen Lundy is a wonderful singer and composer. She is fantastic is this live concert performance in a small theatre in Los Angeles. She is supported by a group of outstanding musicians in performances of her own compositions. The musicians include Bobby Watson, Steve Turre, Victor Lewis, Smitty Smith, Nathan East, Billy Childs, Robert Glasper, Phil Upchurch and Mark Shim. The photography and sound are first rate. At times, there are two drummers and three bassists on stage, but the music supports the numbers of musicians, and things stay organized. The band looks and sounds like they are having a great time. Ms. Lundy displays her wonderful vocal range and dynamite personality. There are many fine female jazz singers at this time, but Carmen Lundy stands apart because she also such a wonderful songwriter. She is deserving of a larger audience and much wider recognition."
2,old friend...,"this is an eminent jazz singer and composer in outstanding form! carmen is absolutely wonderful and the music she dresses herself in is supreme. a love supreme, this one is. a love supreme..."
2,Reuters Guide to World Bond Market,"This readable work helps clarify the vastness and the growth of the world bond market. The focus is mostly on the G-7 countries. Topics include the global economy, technical outlook, and country-by-country politics, ratings, and public debt. The information is dated which is understandable in such a fast moving market. It is a great overview. I would buy a new and expanded edition if it were offered."
2,Hasn't broken yet,I've had this wine opener for close to three months now and it's working very well. Not one damaged cork. But everyone else's reviews about this thing breaking down has me nervous. I only hope mine stays healthy because it is a fine product so far!
2,IT DOES THE JOB,"I wasn't thrilled with this binder, because the metal rings catch a lot and they don't entirely touch, but it holds my papers together. I would recommend it for someone who doesn't want to pay $10 for a binder and doesn't intend on opening it and closing it regularly."
2,great buy,"cannot get same great deal even buying the store name products. dependable, easy to use and ships quickly. would purchase this product again."
2,Good Binder.,"I received this binder today and was disappointed. The binder is of good quality but it does not have the four pockets advertised. It only has two. The rest of the description seems accurate. Having just received them, I can't speak for the lasting durability but I was not disappointed in the overall quality. If you want the extra pockets, check out another binder."
2,House Oversight,"This binder is EXACTLY what I needed to keep my pages organized. As an important Congressional leader, I have many pages in my office, and hope to have a steady supply of new ones coming in the future. As soon as I saw that one of the features of this binder is back-mounted rings that allow pages to lie flat, I knew I had found the perfect tool for organizing pages. I had never really even thought of using binders to organize them, but this really keeps them under control. Thanks for the great idea, Mitt!"
2,"Yes, it is a 2.5"" SATA enclosure","It does a decent job of providing a USB interface to your 2.5"" SATA drive. Nothing great, nothing terrible."
2,works well,"Hassle-free installation. I have a couple of ATA drive enclosures too, but this one is better quality. I read of SATA enclosures that proved useless because underpowered. I didn't want that to happen with this one, which is why I chose the Macally. One reviewer noted that sometimes the second USB plug is not needed; however, my Toshiba 200 gig drive would not spin without extra power. Luckily I have a 5V 300mA AC adaptor for an external CD burner and it works great with the Macally, limiting the USB requirement to a single plug. For info, the adaptor is GME model GFP121U-0520.No mention in enclosure manual about supplying separate power. Dock one star."
2,Works Great,"This 2.5"" enclosure really works well... The extra USB for extra power is not always needed. Some USB ports can push the drive with the data USB alone connected. Small, neat, compact, no wires. Just be careful when removing the Hard Drive; you could break off the LED to the front; but it's pretty strong (self tested)."
2,Great product with a flaw,"A very nice product that works great.... no video problems at all and the key switch works as advertised and much better than having to throw a switch on a box. It is nicely designed. HOWEVER, after using the item and then removing it and going back to a direct plug in of mouse and keyboard on my new Compaq Presario, the computer would not boot up unless I had the cables attached. I could not even get into safe mode with winXP. I had to go to a USB keyboard in order to get back into windows and work as before. This must be a flaw that no one else has reported since all others seem to continue using the IOGEAR GCS62 on two computers. Beware if you want it for only a temporary period."
2,Perfect gift foe an Auburn Graduate.,My son-in-law loved these cuff-links from his Auburn University! They are a good quality with some weight to them. This is a fantastic gift idea.
2,It inspired this business owner,"Mr Slutsky's book had many suggestions in it which I have put to very good and profitable use. Because of the suggestions in his book, I have secured a weekly column on the topic which my business focuses on and got a large newspaper to do an article on me and my business (with a fantastic response!). Thanks Jeff!"
2,The only playset from The Chamber of Secrets!,"This playset is not even in stores yet!(as of February of 2002) It is from year 2! Don't be fooled, the picture amazon.com has is of Hagrid's Hut. The playset includes the forbidden forest, platform 9 3/4, and Hagrids Hut, and it is the last playset to connect to the world of Hogwarts. Inside is the whomping willow, which can grab the Weasley's blue car, and it has a spider web inside with Aragog the spider. It includes a Ron and Harry little figure. It won't be available in stores till a couple months."
2,Jessica Again,"This was once again a good book in her series of murder she wrote books. I have read all but the last one; Trick and Treachery. I have followed her tv series and books for many years and hope she continues to write more. When I read any of her books I can almost feel myself in the tv version, like I am there and one of the characters. Jessica Fletcher is a wonderful writer and I hope that she will be around for years to come, writing more of the Murder She Wrote series."
2,Enjoyable!,"My 4-year old isn't the best at sitting still for board games but he really gets into this one! He's dinosaur obsessed right now so he loves that he gets to play as a dinosaur and he does well remembering their different attributes. There are natural disasters, dinosaur attacks and challenges that seem to hold his interest.We've played it several times since getting it for Christmas & I can see that it will be a favorite for awhile."
2,A Great Game!,"My 6 year old son received this game for Christmas from his grandmother. We have played it about 3 times a day every day since we got it! Any dino-obsessed kid would love this game. It doesn't take that long to play and even the dinosaurs that seem like they don't have many good qualities can win. There are typos on some of the cards, but it's not that big of deal. He loves to pretend that he is the dinosaur from the game. He even plays it by himself because he loves it so much!"
2,A personal opinion,"I bought 'survival or extinction' the dinosaur game on a trip to the USA for my kids. My daughter is 6 years old and my son is 9, both are fascinated with dinosaurs. My wife and I played the game with our children, and i must say, that was one of the best activities we shared with our kids. I thought the game had an interesting angle of each one of us becoming a different dinosaur, and competing with each other, we definitely had our unique personalities and virtues. we were kidding each other for days later. The children remembered so much about different kinds of dinosaurs, their eating habits, their natural habitats and the challenges they faced to survive. It is rare to see a game which is so much fun and educational at the same time."
2,Fun and more!,"As a science teacher, I'm always on the lookout for fun games that reinforce concepts. This game is fun-- my 3rd graders love it (and older: former students remembered the game three years later and asked to borrow it to play on a 6th grade free day!). It also teaches good science concepts, unlike many board games that have a science title but then just have the ""roll and move"" approach that has nothing to do with the concepts. Herbivores, carnivores, habitat, reproduction rate, natural disasters, speed and strength all affect your survival in this game! It used to be available only at specialty toy stores-- I'm glad to see it available here."
2,Awesome educational game!,"My 4 year-old, now 5 year old, loves this game. There is a lot of reading required for the game but that doesn't hinder my son's enjoyment. The game challenges him to make good decisions and he likes choosing which dinosaur to be. I cannot recommend this game highly enough. Excellent."
2,Wish it would have said it was a reiusse,"Having read all the Murder She Wrote books, I was quite confused with this one as I was reading it. I felt that I had read it before, but was confused because it stated she had just met Inspector Sutherland. I knew that she had met him before thru previous novels. Also, the title was one that had been used in previuos series. Now I found out that it is a reissue. The book should have stated this. The credit page did state that April 2000 was the first Signet printing but should have stated it was a reissue. This is what has bothered me. Still, love the entire series, each book is just as good as the one before. Own them all. Can't wait until the next ones come out."
2,Must Read!!,This book is timeless. I first read it in the late eighties and the subject matter still applies today. A must read for all African Americans who want to succeed in business.
2,Simple and easy to use,This product is simple and easy to use.It has the most common sizes. It comes with an alignment tool that helps you center the route on the latch.Only down side is it leaves a hold on the jamb where it is mounted.
2,"If you struggle with Bitterness, this is the book for you!","I read this book because of it's inclusion in a Bible study I was involved in. I had no idea what a life-changing book this would be for me. Bunny Wilson,the author, does an incredible job of detailing her life of bitterness and rebellion due to a lack of unconditional love from her mother. She shows with vivid word pictures that betrayals can lead to bitterness which is like a crying, whining, baby. The only way she could stop this cycle of bitterness and rebellion which was being passed to her own children was through unconditional love. The most impressive thing I felt she said in the book was that she was demanding something that her mother didn't have to give - unconditional love, a gift her mother had not been given. If you've ever been hurt or betrayed in some way, this book will help you see how to get through without becoming bitter. Fast and easy reading but full of great insight!!"
2,Bitterness Unveiled,"This book is excellent. For those of us who have been through hard times in life, and have had situations that have been hard to let go. This book will aid you toward the godily way to view your situation. Bunny even tells you about some of her experiences, which sort of gives you a new light. I highly recommend this book!"
2,From the Publisher,"""Millions of us have loved B. Kliban's Cat for a couple of decades now, ever since we were first introduced to the frolicky feline in the mid 1970s through the now-classic book 'Cat.' Kliban's Cat is one of the most beloved icons of popular culture. The drawings and paintings Kliban created have lost none of the appeal that first grabbed us back then and that continues to grab initiates today.""CatDreams brings together the joyfully mesmerizing paintings Kliban executed for a series of calendars first published between 1977 and 1981 and juxtaposes them with many of his irresistible cartoon drawings. A keepsake volume that generations of Cat lovers--and soon-to-be Cat-lovers--will bask in for years to come, it is the first full-color book to compile all of Kliban's calendar paintings, allowing us, at last, to keep all our Cats under one roof. 96 pages, size: 10.25 x 8.25"". 84 full-color painting reproductions and cartoons. Smythe-sewn paperback book with flaps.""-- Pomegranate"
2,STORYbook,"I only bought this STORYbook release because I am Skynyrd music collector. This is the exact same 2cd song list and linear notes as released in the U.S.A. under ""GOLD"" in a jewel case for half the cost. The hardback STORYbook is high quality material. All songs previously released."
2,Pretty figurine for the money,"I'm sure that our granddaughter, who is 9 and loves everything to do with princesses, will love this princess to add to her collection. It is some smaller than expected, but is really a beautifully done piece for the cost."
2,Black life in corporate america,"After reading this book it should serve as the catylst for further reading on the up and downside to the pursuant of the ambigious corporate atmosphere. This book deals ardently with the pyscho-social dynamics that affect people of color although written in 1981 it remains still relevant today. This is a must read for any young or seasoned corporate professional. More importantly ""People of Conscience"" whether of color or without should READ!!!!!!!!!!"
2,Rather man-ish,"The first thing my daughter said when seeing this princess out of the box was ""She looks like a MAN!"" And she does. She is not beautiful - her clothing is, but that's where it ends. Seriously - this is a man dressed up like a woman.I told my daughter that most princesses in real life are ugly, and that seemed to placate her.Hope this helps! I'm going to check out some other pieces - maybe one of the ladies-in-waiting will outshine this mogbeast."
2,Seen the tv show? You should definitely check out the books!,"I'm a big Murder She Wrote fangirl. I loved watching the series on tv as a teen and I was thrilled to discover that there is a series of novels set around the characters.Gin and Daggers is the first novel of the series. Jessica is abroad in London for a conference and to visit friend and fellow mystery writer, Marjorie Ainsworth. Her plans to sightsee get derailed when Marjorie turns up dead and Jessica is the prime suspect!I really enjoyed this novel. The mystery was great and kept me guessing till the end. Jessica is a likable sleuth and there were plenty literary references to keep my bookish senses amused. I will definitely be reading more books in this series."
2,Ice-T and Rutger Hauer what could go wrong?,"The answer is nothing. I have seen this movie atleast 20 times. Yeah the story is not exactly some gripping thing that will make you think but come on ICE T! Its just one of those movies every time its on TNT or TBS you just have to watch it. I have recently gotten the DVD there is a lack of extras on it but all in all for the [money] I paid for it, it was totally worth it."
2,Fascinating and informative,"I found this an excellent read when I was studying Anne Boleyn. While never becoming too bogged down in details, it tells her story compellingly and with the necessary human touch which makes Anne's story so engrossing.Focusing on faction as one of the major causes of Anne's downfall, we are taken from her contested date of birth to her final end, through the whims of the king, life at court and her dubious romances. Ives gives the legends a brisk working over and gives the facts clearly with all the available evidence. This is THE book on Anne to read and I strongly recommend it to anyone studying her life."
2,The Collar,"I like the fencing system, but the collars need some work. The collar is very flimsy and will not stay on the notch it is set on. We have had to use duct tape to secure the collar so we could use the clasp. It is a design flaw."
2,Dog Control Training,"This collor works great with the remote control!!! Most of the time, you only need to push the green botton (Tone from the collor) and the dog knows whats coming next if she dosen't stop right there. Great way to train without harming you best pup..."
2,Great!,"I was super nervous after reading the other reviews, but we needed another collar for our fence because our first one died. We've owned this collar for over a year and it's been perfect. We've had no problems at all with the clasp or the battery.2/19/13 Follow-up: Collar is still functioning perfectly, with no issues of it coming off the dog. I wouldn't hesitate to get another if I needed it."
2,One of my favorite romantic comedies,"I'm not from New York, but there's just something about this movie. The small parts alone almost make it worth a watch... Megan Mullaly (now on ""Will & Grace"") as a drunken bar conquest, Richard Kind (of ""Mad About You"" and currently on ""Spin City"") as a partygoer, Todd Field (Nick Nightingale in ""Eyes Wide Shut"" and the most unexplained/useless character in ""The Haunting"") as Cecil.I loved Mantegna's ability to get by on attitude (""I can work with that"" - ""box seats, the Mets, tonight""), Jamie Lee Curtis' cameo, Linda Fiorentino's ability to make ""backed up anger"" sound like ""back tabanga"", John Malkovich with a shotgun... and Tom Waits' character of Monte is one of the most loveable onscreen scuzzballs you'll find.It's not a movie you love for the continuity of plot or the great acting throughout. No one in the movie really has to stretch that far. It's a movie you love for its moments (like the howling scene)... and a kickin' soundtrack."
2,I call him Moffie!,"Great price for a surprisingly heavy action figure (he's made of high-quality vinyl and plastic). The facial sculpt is very nice. The hands are a little dopey (they can't really hold anything). On the plus side, he stands quite well on his own. For the price, I'm delighted. Shipping was quick, too."
2,"Early 90's cheese, but still edible","I watched this when it came out back in 94, and watched it again this past week. It reeks of some 90's cheese, not the best acting bits of story that ought to be better, etc. but in the end it's a compelling story line and keeps attention for 90 minutes."
2,Blue Chips,"Nick Nolte, Mary McDonnell, and Shaq all did some great acting in this movie, I was glad I ordered it.thanks!!"
2,"It's basketball , It's showtime","All right ,it's not Shakespeare in love,but this movie is electrifying, thanks to the pro-players performances;you know,come on,we're talking about Shaq Attaq,it's Penny's showtime,there are even Bob Cousy and Larry Bird! Hmm,I think I forgot Nick Nolte.He has been really great."
2,An entertaining look at college basketball recruiting,"Nick Nolte plays an explosive, but caring college basketball coach who's career is on the decline due to recruiting problems. Nolte decides to lose his ethics and give recruits money, cars, houses, etc. to get them to come to his school. A serious sports movie without the usual fairytale ending. The basketball action is exciting and realistic because most of it is played by real NBA stars, like Shaq, Penny Hardaway, Allan Houston, George Lynch and many others. Bob Cousy is better than expected as the athletic director who doesn't miss foul shots."
2,Gloria Trevi Siempre LA MEJOR!,Esta pelicula se las recomiendo es muy chistosa y esta muuuuuuuuy Buena Definitiva mente se las recomiendo por que esta como quiere!
2,GREAT ACTION,"ALTHOUGH THE LANGUAGE WAS PRETTY ROUGH IN PLACES, MY HUSBAND & I LIKE THIS VERSION BEST OF THE MOVIES BASED ON ""THE MOST DANGEROUS GAME"". THE CAST WAS WONDERFUL, THE SETTING WAS GREAT, THE ACTION WAS EXCITING & WE LOVED THE ENDING!"
2,Satisfied Customer,"I would RATE Amazon 2nd to No one in this field of delivering the Goods in a Prompt Professional manner.We love Amazon for all its resourcefulness & inexpensive quality products that it some how gets possession of to sell to its fans from the Orig. Merchants.No matter what the product from gadgets to electronics, books to movies, Amazon blazes a trail that can't be contested by any legal entities....So basically I'm saying, Amazon has no worthy competition, so it makes sense to only spend your hard earned $money$ with Amazon.com....Thanks for being the best & delivering the best, keep up the Good Work...Peter J.

2,Great story line with good action!,If you like action/adventure you will find this movie entertaining and catching your interest and attention. Has an original story line with creative sub-plots. Ice-T at his best! Movie has great cast of actors. I enjoyed this movie and happy to add it to my collection.
2,Great Movie,This was a great movie.The price was a good value also.Service was great an all around good experience with purchase.
2,"I expected more, but not bad","Four UFC champs, three runners-up, and another good fighter battled for $150,000. This is the first UFC event where there were judges involved. This was a solid event, but nothing really spectacular."
2,Fascinating!,"Wow - what an incredible read! Goes to show that all this luv shuv can certainly rottofy one's life eh? From a quote from Iliad to the vulgar humour of ""chohli ke peeché kya hai"" Rushdie brilliantly struts his stuff. (...)Oh, I must say it does help to be very familiar with India before plunging yourself into this book."
2,Wonderful world of imagination and humour,The world created by Rushdie sucks you out of your own. As an Irish person the idea of reality and dreamworld is not a difficult one to grapple with. I wonder is it a function of being post colonial or specifically post British empire. Irish poets and singers for generations lived and wrote in dreamworlds of their own.This century saw many writers emerge that share the same kind of compulsions and radical rethink of the novel that Salman seems to espouse.As rich as a rich novel can be and full of the wonderful sense of humour that sets him apart.I can not wait to read the next book.
2,I love my grill pan,I use this grill pan all the time to grill vegetables. It's quick and easy and the results are delicious. Clean up is easy because nothing sticks!
2,You need to have headrest in back seat to use,"I purchased this item for my 6 pound Papillon. It's very high quality and an excellent size for a small dog.Please Note: If you are planning on using this in your REAR seat, you will need to have an adjustable headrest (as shown in the graphic here for the product. If you look closely at the picture, you will see that this item comes with a ""backboard"" which is great for a front bucket seat but in the rear, if you do not have the aforementioned headrest, you will not be able to secure this seat and because of the backboard (non detachable), you will not be able to even rig it.That said, I like this item very much, as does my Pap. It's very comfy and certainly is a 'snap' to set up, as a previous reviewer noted.The manufacturer is shipping these with a stronger and thicker connector for the top assemblage that is indeed better and more secure."
2,"LUV, LUV, LUV","I just LUV this car seat! I have a Cavalier King Charles Spaniel named Sadie who now weighs 17 pounds. I bought this delux car seat when she was just a little puppy and she still fits in it. However she's a little squished when she tries to lie down now that she is full grown, but there's still plenty of room when she sits up and is just cruising. So I bought the larger one and keep it in the back seat for her when my boyfriend and I are in the front seat, but when he's not with us I whip this one out of the trunk. It's so easy to just put over the head rest, and she jumps in the car and uses the console arm rest as a stepping stool to get into it. She really loves to go cruising and look out the window. We live in Hawaii and I especially like the fact that the shipping was free! I loved this so much I bought a spare one when the price dropped just in case this one broke or went out of stock. Since she will live a long time I want this car seat to be around as long as she will."
2,I like this doggie carseat!,"This seat is well-made, works as stated in the sales description. We have a golf cart that we use it on when we go camping, and it works nicely on that too. My puppy (he's 3)hasn't gotten used to it yet, but I definitely think it is safer and I feel better knowing he is secure in his seat rather than on my lap riding in the car. I'm not so sure it was worth the price..... I think $25 would have been more reasonable. Half the asking price, but then I saw the others offered at that price and I don't think they were as nice. I ordered the small and my 8 pound Maltese just does fit inside. Overall, I like the product."
2,rose,"Our recently adopted toy poodle loves it after a period of adjustment. Loves to be able to see out & then snuggle down when he wants to sleep. I feel that he is so much safer then roaming around the car & disturbing the driver. Glad I purchased the medium size, per reviews, it's just right for a toy poodle weighing in at 8lbs."
2,Good booster seat,"I needed to contain my 4 mo. old mini-doxie puppy and decided this would work for her. Assembly and installation took me a little longer than expected, despite reading the directions. The booster was installed in the backseat of a Honda CRV, so I don't have to move it when I have another passenger. It doesn't seem overly sturdy and I am not sure about the 18lb. weight limit. My doxie wears a collar. The seat has a nylon strap with a snap connector to secure your dog in the seat. Well, my doxie managed to twist herself about and chew through the nylon strap, all the while I was driving to my location. When I arrived at my destination, she was no longer tied, but fortunately remained in the seat. I have since purchased thin chain, still using the snap connector and threw out the nylon strap. My doxie likes the seat and I know she can't chew through the chain. I'll wait to see if she will need a larger seat, but this one has worked well so far."
2,A Good Product,"I like good cookware, and own mostly Calphalon products. So, when I decided to try the Kitchen Aid, I wasn't expecting the quality of a high-end cooking utensil. Well, I am very impressed, and pleasantly surprised. Cooks evenly, easy clean up, and the red color is perfect. Highly recommend."
2,We love it!,My little guy just loves this booster seat! And so do I! I have bucket seats and it fits just fine. Works in the front seat or the back. Now my chi can see the world as it passes us by!
2,Solid Second Novel,"""All you need to know is I went cop and he went con. Worlds collided."" So says PI Lincoln Perry about himself and childhood best buddy, Ed Gradduck. Now, Gradduck's dead. Perry feels guilty, and he and partner, Joe Pritchard, labor to untangle a complicated series of crimes stretching back twenty years.As in TONIGHT I SAID GOODBYE, Koryta's prose is elegant in its simplicity and the dialogue hums. The characters continue techni-colorful. The story, despite its density, holds together very neatly.All in all, it's a better book than TONIGHT I SAID GOODBYE. A must read for Koryta fans--indeed for any devotee of crime genre fiction."
2,not too bad,"This video collection showcases Hal Ketchum's stunning tenor in a reasonably good way. ""Stay Forever,"" ""Past the Point of Rescue,"" and ""Small Town Saturday Night"" are some of the better songs featured. If you are a fan of Mr. Ketchum, you might like this. It goes well with his Hits Collection CD."
2,The finest work of poetry and music,This classic poetry mixed with Herbie Mann is a treason. Walter Benton's This is my Beloved is a love story of themost magnificent porportions.
2,Excellent Movie-Powerful Witness!!!,"This is an excellent movie! I saw it a few years ago and then again recently on TBN. The acting was truly superb and very convincing, too. Although not of Asian descent, I work in cross-cultural ministry with Asian-American college students and young adults. So the cultural things in reference to China were very helpful.More than the above, I think this movie is a very powerful tool for evangelism. Many modern day Christians in America should see this movie. It will strengthen and challenge your Christian faith beyond measure. I'm glad that this movie is still around and still being shown on t.v. ..."
2,God Send Movie,Wonderful movie that really depicts the cruelty of man and how people are forced to take a strong opinion on their life's beliefs through hard times. I would definitely recommend this movie to anyone also explains what the Chinese people faced during that time.
2,Outdated but Useful,"Those of us who used these formulas can often get insight into modern analysis with newer calculators. This is very dated and few TI-59s are still extant but I recall the coding and therefore, can reverse engineer the mode of programming to apply to more modern ways.. I await Andoid and Iphone apps for similar uses."
2,Koryta's best,"I stumbled onto Michael Koryta's books through the reviews of other readers. He is a great writer and really hits the mark with Sorrow's Anthem. Although it helps to read the series in order, its not required. The characters in this book are even more fully developed than in his previous novels. I can't wait to read #4."
2,Totally amazing grill pan,"I am SO in love with my KitchenAid grill pan. Nothing sticks to it! Believe me, I've given it lots of opportunities to let me down, and it always comes through. I've made steak fajitas, grilled chicken, salmon fillets - all cooked perfectly, quickly and with those great grill marks to boot! Clean up is easy, too. I highly recommend this to anyone who loves cooking. A great buy!"
2,"Light, but good","For a pan that's relatively light in weight, this does a nice job of grilling. I especially recommend it for items that are not too hefty: it worked well for salmon, vegetables and pineapple. It's large enough to grill several items at once, cleans nicely and I look forward to using it in the summer with the bounty from my garden and orchard.But I'm glad I have a tough old heavy model as well."
2,Great Grill Pan,"This grill pan is a great value for the money spent. It is light weight, cleans up easily and does the job. You may not get the deepest grill marks as you might with a cast iron grill pan, but the food still comes off looking grilled."
2,For the fan,This is not an easy read. It is dense and odd. I liked it. It's not unlike Midnight's Children in it's span and slightly magical events. There are parts that are funny and parts that are brutal. Much like India. I'd say read if if you're a fan of Rushdie's work.
2,Magical characters and story,"I now count this novel among my favorites in the magical realism genre. Rushdie creates complex, fascinating and often deeply-flawed characters, and then weaves them into a narrative spanning continents and centuries amidst some of history's most intriguing moments. Highest praise."
2,"brilliant, enticing, magical !","This book has some clever wordplay and Rushdie proves he is a master of sentences. The reading is however a bit harsh and takes some getting used to. Overall, however, the book is spellbinding with some memorable characters and remarks: O' falsely foul, foully false love !One thing that did leave me puzzled was the fact that the Moor, who is narrating the story, is so well versed in the english language considering that he didn't even attend school properly, according to the book. Is this supposed to be part of the magical mystical fantasy of the story?Enjoy the book and the questions it raises for yourself.I'll probably read it again, but Midnight's Children remains my all time favourite."
2,"Slow at first, but couldn't put it down","Rushdie is one of my faves -- his prose is absolutely stunning, and his use of semi-colloquial language is fantastic, giving it real feeling. I'm now reading ""The Ground Beneath her Feet"" and I am loving it! I found ""moor"" a bit slow at the beginning -- i had to put it away for a few months, but once I picked it up again, I couldn't stop reading it! Anyone who likes a good, langorous read with fascinating characters, definitely pick up one of Rushdie's books."
2,What entertainment!,"Salman Rushdie has shown himself to be above sensationalism with this book. Far from the Jihad against him being his only claim to fame, this book solidifies it. I have not read such a wonderfully sarcastic, funny, and intelligent book in quite a while. Perhaps Rushdie figures himself to be another James Joyce to a smaller degree, using quite many different langauges. Luckily, I have close Indian friends and have been raised in Europe, so I humbly submit that I can read through this book whole (and laugh all the way!). Some of my friends have found this book hard reading but I think it is merely a fact of getting used to the style of writing that Rushdie employs. I highly reccomend this book to anyone!"
2,Wonderful book,"One of the best books I've ever read, if not the best of them. Salman Rushdie at his best!"
2,Big Fan of Rushdie,"I love Rushdie, though have to admit that some of his stuff has been hard to read. This book, though, is not. A mix of fantasy and Indian life. Very funny. Rushdie is incredible. Not as enjoyable, for me, as Midnight's Children."
2,Exuberant prose,"Rushdie, like Nabokov and Joyce, musters an acute sense of the sound of words. While character development tends to fall prey to thematic exposition, the joy of listening to his words spill out from the page (one can't read ""The Moor's Last Sigh"" without hearing it) propels the story to its breathless conclusion."
2,"beautiful, funny, an immense and lovely experience","This book is quite simply one of the best I have ever read. Amazingly well-written, witty, expansive and amazingly accessible, it is modern literature at its very finest. This is the first Rushdie book that I have read, and I am sorry it took me so long to take a second look at this controversial writer. I enjoyed it greatly and look forward to reading the rest of the Rushdie books. Highly recommended."
2,Sigh . . .,"I began this book 3 times before I was able to penetrate Rushdie's language enough to make it past the first 5 pages. But once I got to reading it in earnest, I couldn't put it down. The only thing I ever knew about the author was through all the controversy around the Satanic Verses. The whole thing sounded scary and political to me. I never realized what a beautiful and poetic writer he is. Reading this book was like having a love affair- it left me with a light head and a full belly.The Moor's Last Sigh has left me hungry for more Rushdie. Read this book with a clear head. I guarantee you will enjoy it."
2,Very nice modem for the price.,"I purchased the SupraMax 56K faxmodem and was amazed at the easy intallation, I was up and running in about 15 minutes. Once the installation process was finished I took advantage of the faxing software (very user friendly).Furthermore, since I have started using this modem I am getting connection speeds of 4800+ consistently. I did run acrooss a scenario where one particular ISP did not support K56Flex they would only support V.90 so, I called Diamond tech support and within minutes they guided me to the correct upgrade to download which solved the problem.I would recommend this modem to anyone looking for an affordable,easy to use modem with the flexabilty of V.90 & K56Flex technologies."
2,"One of their best, and don't bother looking for a plot","Hardy brings forgotten soldier Laurel home for dinner, and that's the entire plot. This very funny comedy has some great visual humor that can be enjoyed again and again. An excellent choice for first-time Laurel & Hardy viewers, and confirmed Laurel & Hardy fanatics will love this."
2,"Great pan, great price",Used this pan and love it. Its heavy and sturdy and so easy to clean. The price is great.
2,Superb!,"This grill pan has become my sidekick. It grills both meat and vegetables to perfection. I enjoy having a burger that isn't floating in its own grease. It is well-constructed, and cleanup is a breeze."
2,great pan,"I love my KitchenAid 11 inch skillet. I have finally found a pan that keeps food from sticking. It is very versatile-I have cooked eggs, hamburgers and dishes with sauce. Everything comes out great, food looks good and I can clean up in minutes. Wished I would have bought 2 pans!"
2,"Excellent quality, ease of use, affordability...",This is an excellent buy for the first time user. I bought this for my parents to use who have very little technological prowess and they love it. The USB connection and simplied instruction booklet make for unintimidating ease of use - an important factor when buying for older family members. The picture quality is great for the price.
2,THIS BOOK HAS SO MUCH GOING FOR IT!,"My son loves this book. Even though he has had it for a few years and can read books that are more difficult he still enjoys this one. It's the story of a class that is planning to exchange pen-pal letters with an other school. But there is much more to the story . It teaches about learning to get to know someone before you prejudge them and how boys and girls can become friends. It also is about friends, bullies, and maintaining friendships out side of school with writing. It's a really great book. The art work is charming and my son thinks it's a scream! This would be a good book for either boys or girls. I feel it is also a good transition from books with only a few words per page to longer books. Even though there are 48 pages there are color pictures on everypage so it isn't intimidating. I think this would be a nice book as a gift before a child goes to sleep away camp because it talks both of making new friends and writing letters to stay in touch."
2,Ode to New Shoes,I just loved these shoes the second I opened the box. The box in itself is an experience. Fit like a glove and they were surprisingly comfortable. I will hunting down any Poetic Licence shoes I can find.
2,One of the best children's books ever written,"I am no longer a child, but I remember this book as fondly nowas I did when I read it years ago (perhaps because I read it moretimes than I am old). The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe is truly one of the most memorable and magical books ever written. Any person of any age who has not read Lewis' masterpiece should put it in his or her shopping basket right away.If you're an adult, allow the book to rekindle the sense of wonder and imagination that so many of us abandon when we age. If you have a child, let him or her experience the joy and adventure of the wardrobe for the first time. I guarantee it will become the most beloved book in any child's collection."
2,One Eyed Cat by Paula Fox Unbelievable Descriptions!,One Eyed Cat by Paula FoxThis book is about a wondrous boy named Ned. His uncle gave him a gun for Christmas. Ned sneaks it out and shoots a cat. When he comes back he lies to his family but stops.I loved this book because Ned changes his actions when he knows what he did wrong.The author will share how someone can lie so much and find the right way out.
2,El Cajon,"11 year old Ned Wallis is looking for rifle in the attic. But nhe can not resist taking for a test run, before he knows he shoots the gun in moonlight dark. Ned lives in a small town in New York and his father is a minister's son. I like that this book should have got a 4 stars becase it has a good moral. When Ned returns to his house he see in the attic face looking down from the window. One day when Ned was helping his older neighborhe spots a one eyed cat he thinks about want he had shot that night. Can Ned keep or tell his awful secert."
2,The Greatest book!,"I've read some other books by Paula Fox, ONE-EYED CAT is definately the best. I just stoped reading her other books but this one I couldn't put down. All of the intense or unknowing parts of the book kept me reading so I could figure out what happens next. This was a great book and I would recomend it to anyone. It's a book that you just have to finish."
2,Smooth read and a true pleasure,"I enjoyed this book tremendously. The pace flowed quickly and smoothly throughout the entire book, and the conclusion, though a bit choppy, truly seemed appropriate for the situation. Thankfully, everything doesn't necessarily end on a perfect note, so I do appreciate that Wilson took the time to think about what ""should"" happen, rather than what everyone else would ""like"" to happen. There is a love story which flows in the middle of the book, but I don't think this was truly fully developed (the reason for the 4 stars). I did enjoy the technology and the frightening (and almost too-real) look at what the future holds, or may hold for us in the real world. The characters were well thought-out and though a bit hyperbolic, came across nicely. An excellent take on the future/past relationship without killing the concept. Overall, an excellent and quick read."
2,car seat review,"I find this seat ok. it is pretty bulky in my saturn sedan. my boy seems to like it, but again when he sleeps his head is not supported. i find this complaint with all others(reviews) i've read,though. I wish also that the cup holder was on both sides(so i could choose which side of the car to put him in). i have 2 children in seats...so it would be nice to have that choice. also because of it's bulkiness or maybe my car size, his feet are right against the driver/passenger seat, so we have to be carefull at how far back we put the seat(so not to squoosh his feet). All in All...it's a good seat."
2,Awesome audio but awkward controls,"The audio from the large lighter size player is awesome, incredible.The controls are awkward and setup and operation takes a long time. The manual is more detailed than for most products but the player does not always respond consistently in accordance with the instructions.If you are patient, have time to invest in figuring the player out, can accept the ocassional inconsistent control responses, this is a good player for the price.The earplugs are useless...the Sony plugs not any better, unless you have earlobes of steel (plugs fall out)...I recommend a good comfortable headset."
2,Ned learns a lesson from disobeying his parents.,"In Tyler, New York a tall skinny dark haired boy named Ned gets a gun for his birthday from his uncle. He is told not to use it, but he disobeys and goes into the attic, gets the gun, and goes outside where he later shoots it.Someone hears him. No one punishes him but he sees a one eyed cat at Mr. Scully's woodshed. It shook it's head constantly as though there was something in front of it that made seeing difficult. Perhaps, Ned wondered in fear, he is the something the cat sought. The shadows of Ned's uncertanties are dispelled, even as their mystery deepens. The cat also teaches Ned a lesson he will never forget for the rest of his life."
2,Come On!,Everybody! Why isn't anybody reviewing this! You have to get it. Please this work of beuty can't be shoved off like this. Buy it. It's cheap and perfect. It's awesome. No Cons.
2,Written by a clinician who gets his hands dirty.,"Richard M. Foxx is a hands on clinician who writes from personal data based experience. His work is practical and concise. The more indepth book ""Decreasing Behavior"" is a wonderful companion to this book."
2,A BREATH OF FRESH AIR !,"GOT TO READ THIS ONE! Intertwining plot & characters. Jared and Emily (main characters) once dreamed of a life together. Napoleanic war, high society, spies, love and honor affected their fate. An exciting read from start to finish. No hum drum, prefab or extraneous writing here. A magnetic story that will draw you in & keep you. Can't wait for the next one!"
2,Great read!!,"This was a great book! I picked it up just before I got on a long plane ride, and found myself wishing my flight was longer so I could finish it! Lighthearted regency but with deep themes running through. There is just enough setting of the stage for you to know who the characters are before the excitement starts, and it doesn't finish until the book is over! I was thrilled with the interwoven plot lines and twists and turns in the story. Although I like to think I'm a smart reader, I certainly didn't predict all of the surprises. I was so enthralled by this book that I purchased the next book in the series for my flight back home! Well written, serious but not too heavy, just what I was looking for! The secondary characters are hilarious! I wish every book I picked up on a whim would be this good! I will absolutely be looking for more Teresa McCarthy novels in the future!"
2,GREAT READ!,"love how the brothers try to take care of their little sister,not knowing how strong she really is, great love story, Love how this author writes, I have read the complete clearbrook series"
2,"Best book of its genre, that I have read in a long time",I loved the twist and turns of individual story lines that blended in the end. I loved the humor contrasting with the soul searching that we all in real life have to endure.
2,Exquisite Regency romance,"If you like the romances from Jane Austen's time, this is a book you are not allowed to miss. It is an excellent romance story, beautifully written, that got me all hooked up. I warmly recommend it as the perfect read for romance lovers."
2,Best Player I have seen,"Its fundamentally wonderful device squeezing in lots of features in its cute n tiny shape. I didn't see any player as compact as this. Only con I find is the price, probably the highest among its peers."
2,Superb Book!,"The One-Eyed Cat is a superb book for all occasions. I got so caught up in it one night that I read it for over 3 hours! It's about a boy named Ned that doesn't exatly have the easiest life. His mom is in a wheelchair and he has a very strict housekeeper that won't let him do anything. On his 10th birthday he gets a gun from his uncle, his father doesn't approve of him having it and says he can't use it yet. Then one night he sneeks up to the attic and steals it! To find out what happens after that, you're going to have to read the book yourself!"
2,Sawyer Brown hits it,"Everything Sawyer Brown does is great, but this one could be longer, and I would like to see some of the old videos come out on DVD The music is always great, but my favorite part is watching Mark Miller, I have never seen a white man that could move like that. I think Mark should be on Dancing with the Stars."
2,Great journal articles,"Because they are edited, some articles leave out equally as important and interesting information. Overall an extremely informative and easy to use book."
2,"The kids love it, but beware small pieces!","My boys just had to have this playset, and I was lucky enough to find it for a reasonable price here on AMAZON. The seller was great, shipped very fast and packed it well. The playset itself is fun for the kids, although it is NOT for small kids because it has little pieces and is made of a plastic that will break easy. This is very hard to find but we have the castle and most of the other sets and really needed this one to complete the set. My favorite piece is the spider web!"
2,Love the cord,"My apartment building has power surge problems. I have surge protectors on just about every outlet. This isn't the most powerful one I own (1,000 Joules protection is relatively good but not spectacular) but I'm not using it for delicate electronic equipment. I had an extension cord running from behind the couch so I could use that outlet for a fan and a couple of lamps. With the Tripp Lite TLP712 I don't have dangerous extension cords all over the place, I have use of that outlet and the things I plug into it are protected.It does the job I bought it for just fine."
2,Power strip.,"This is something I recommend to everyone. During thunderstorms, if you don't use these power strips your electronics can get destroyed when you get a power surge. Inseam lot of these."
2,Strong protection. 15amp rated. 15 foot cord.,"Just what i was looking for! Tripp Lite is always solid. Strong construction,15amp rated,15 foot cord. Great features for live sound application."
2,Fantastic Perfume!,"This has such a clean, fresh scent that people always ask me what I am wearing! I love this and am glad I can still get it at Amazon.com!!"
2,Free and Happy,"This cologne is wonderful. The smell is great and playful. It is fruity, it lasts, it makes you feel happy and carefree. I love this cologne."
2,"Good taste, great price","This was some of the best American sturgeon caviar I've tried, in terms of taste and even texture, although the texture still falls short of the imported roe. For the price, however--even with the big shipping cost to CA--it can't be beat. I would order from this company again."
2,"Persuasive, gutsy, and to the point!","James Sanders provides detailed facts, and his own theory about what happened on the ground, in the water, in the surrounding air space, and aboard doomed Flight 800 on that fateful eveing.His argument is sound and persuasive, but as with any theory, it must be scrutinized carefully. What is great about this book is that Sanders asks the same of the government's theory . . . why don't more people scrutinize what Washington is force-feeding us about this incident.A good, fast read with pictures of some evidence in the middle of the book."
2,The Downing of TWA Flight 800,"I found this to be a very intrigueing book, Mr. Sanders seems to have the evidence of a cover-up about Flight 800's tragic accident. If you are intrested in finding out about Flight 800 this is a very good book to read."
2,"Incredible...Hat's off to Mr. Sanders, a must read!","A complete explaination of what MUST have happened!Peter Salinger WAS correct! and Mr. Sanders putsthe pieces together for us.The government spinmasters are hard at work!When faced with exposure they attack the source of information with comments like: missle?,you think it may have been a missle!Are you a UFO nut too?!, implying that only an idiot would take these facts and come to that conclusion. Look at Roswell or of late Phoenix, Arizona. We are told that what we are seeing is realy nothing, so go back to sleep!I am sadly reminded of the careless comment, ""what IS TRUTH"", attributed to yet another ""pragmatic"" government leader, almost 2,000 years ago-Pilate, the Roman Governor, to a Jewish Rabbi and carpenter....He washed his hands of the matter. This was only one man...Now there are only 238!People will forget...or will they?"
2,Best little gift book I have received.......,"I received this book as a gift from a lady in my office. It is filled with so many (301 to be exact :) positive actions. I leave it on my desk at work and read atleast one a day and try to do that ""random act of kindness"". As the book states, if we all could just do one kind act to help make this world a better place, maybe it would spread to others. Anyways, I enjoy reading this little book and will be purchasing one for each of my girlfriends. Thanks for reading!"
2,For those who enjoy a good Sci Fi book,"In this very good story, we can feel a big influence of Star Trek, since it's an awesome and advanced ship with dinamic crew, and some really look like Kirk, McCoy and cia. The sea is their final frontier, and a ravaged new world is their ""where no man has gone before"". A good balance between action, mistery and both together makes this a worth reading sci-fi novel, and makes you looking forward to reading the next chapters."
2,the best rad,delphi is the most powerful rad to develop WINDOWS apps which can be ported to kylix !!
2,informative,"Ten Thousand Miles Without A Cloud is the first book by Sun Shuyun. It details Sun's experience as she tries to follow in the footsteps on Xuanzang, a Buddhist monk who, in the 7th century, made a pilgrimage through Central Asia and into India, to find the original sutras of the Buddha. Xuanzang made his trip during a time of political unrest, as does Sun; both confront obstacles and both come to understand Buddhism and themselves better for their encounters with others on the way. I found myself checking how many pages left and eyeing my next read with increasing frequency as the book progressed: never a good sign! Readers interested in Buddhism would find this book informative and enjoyable; readers with less of a fascination might find it somewhat repetitive and a bit slow. All those Chinese and Indian gods and historical figures had my eyes glazing over, but I did learn a few noteworthy facts. This was not my first choice of Sun's books: I still hope to read A Year in Tibet."
2,Caural - Paint,"The cover of Caural's Paint EP features two ghostly hip-hoppers, but I'm not sure that's correct. It's more correct to say that this is more the intersection of indie-post-rock and hip-hop. The melodies on ""Inbetween Thoughts,"" to be sure, are built on feedback, ghostly and vague, while ""Red Sunshine"" takes a more upbeat route with its brighter disposition. ""Your Memories on Television"" starts with whale calls, moves into some guitar strums, and floats back out to sea. The final track, ""Clear Vinyl,"" sounds like a lost shoegazing My Bloody Valentine track. Definitely a worthwhile release."
2,Engaging,"Loved the story line. It kept me guessing about who, with whom and where. It was exciting and refreshing. THANKS"
2,A classic work,"When I was first charged with the lightning bolt of the promise of software possibilities, I found this book. It helped me see how to view a microprocessor's capability in a comfortable, natural progression of understanding. It provided me what I wanted to know where I expected to find it. The references to related information, missing in most documentation, always seemed to be both appropriate and conveniently located. It was as if Zaks knew my own, unique desire to learn and how it naturally unfolded. It felt as though he had prepared each of the steps that I would need by having been where I was. It served me tirelessly as a reference until it fell apart. Books of this type are hard to find today."
2,Very entertaining.,"Another book that I couldn't put down. A good plot, strong characters and very entertaining. If you like a romance where the women have charm, beauty and brawn; then you'll enjoy this one."
2,Transforming Your Life Through Reiki,"Having read Janeanne's book from the perspective of a novice in the world of Reiki, I was especially drawn in by her stories of personal transformation. My goal in learning about Reiki is similar: to transform my life through new methods AND new perspectives, which her book helps me do. I would highly recommmend this to anyone who is new to Reiki and is looking for a CONTEXT of Reiki in their life's pursuits."
2,Universal Mount Inlet for Guest Battery Chargers,this Marinco 150CCI Marine Universal Mount Inlet for Guest Battery Chargers with ConnectCharge Plug was just what I needed for my charger and it was a new in the package item. I am pleased with the overall purchase and shipping..........
2,A beautiful tale for everyone,"This beautiful story about a little bird and a kind golden statue who wants to help the poor will go straight to your heart. Though written for children, the lyrical, witty prose of Oscar Wilde and the book's message of love and charity can also be enjoyed by adults. I read this book to my little brother and my mother and I had them both crying at the end. It makes a wonderful bedtime story and also a wonderful introduction to classic literature."
2,LOVE Em',Lovely shoes! Sturdy and so sexxy... I would highly recommend. Of course a shoe of this height is not for the faint of heart
2,Works great,"Our bed frame doesn't have the brackets for mounting a headboard. Instead of getting a whole new headboard I found these plastic ones for a much better price. The installation was easy, the brackets are sturdy and have lasted more than a year at this point. Great buy if you need them."
2,Excellent speakers,"Ive only had my set for a few days, but i am very impressed by the performance of this system. This set is ever bit as good as the klipsch promedia, and much more affordable. the bass is very powerful, and extremely detailed. The satellites are very crisp and clear. The only problem is the that all the controls, except for the volume, are on the back of the sub. if your looking for the best performance from a 5.1 system for the best price, this is the system for you."
2,"There's so much to do that when you beat it, there's still stuff to do...","This game took me all summer to beat. I'm a teacher and I sepnt my entire summer playing this game, I finally beat it at the end of July and when I became Don of NYC there was still stuff to do. This game was weill worth the money because there's always stuff to do!"
2,"Matches the Guest charger plug, but weak securement tab.","I got this as a replacement for one that broke in my boat (the tab that holds the plug in place snapped off). I tried other 'universal' brands that weren't even close in fit to the plug I had. This one matches my Guest charger plug, however, I suspect it will have a similar problem with the holding tab for the plug. If you bend that tab too far or too often, it WILL eventually break off!The securement method could be better, hence the 4 star rating."
2,GOOD,"i don't know about anybody else but i straight up love this game thought it was good beat it the other day great missions mob hit, guns selection but expensive like what and taking over businesses and the fact that they got the real voices for some of the characters made the game went up a bit more in my book...Since where in the making movies in to games thing now i think ""GOODFELLAS"" would make for a good game what do u think?"
2,God on the Mountain CD,"This album by Lynda Randle is a good addition to anyone's religious music collection. I purchased it for the title song, which is a stirring sermonette in itself. Some of the other material was good but not great. I would like to have seen several old-time gospel classics included, but all in all it is good listening and inspirational."
2,"It's Not the Dogs, It's the People! is terrific","Experienced dog trainers enjoy encountering the good, the bad and the difficult human clients Nicole Wilde spotlights with insight, kindness and good humor. Newcomers to the profession -- whether aware or not that, ""It's not the dogs, it's the people,"" can benefit from Wilde's user-friendly advice. Maggie Blutreich, CPDT"
2,Great Insight,"This is a good book to help teach those at the ""other end of the leash."" Information can be direct but most communication is by perception."
2,Wonderful tote,I have a few of the smaller ones and decided I needed a couple big ones for downstairs and they are great. Holds a TON of toys and takes up little space. I love it!!
2,characters of maru,i would like to know what is happening between maru and the masarwa girl who was a teacher at the dilepe viillage.the relationship between the two characters. what is the message of the book.the author is tries to tell us what
2,Overwhelming!,I don't know how anyone could not like this book! This is the best book I've ever read! Who knew a book about 4 children finding a wardrobe could be so exciting?!! All I can say is this book is on the top of the charts for me.
2,"""Don't Ever Go Against the Family""","I bought this game four days ago and I haven't spent much time not playing it. That is always a sign of a game that is worth buying. I have sold all of my Xbox games (with the exception of Halo 2) because I lose interest in them pretty fast, but I think I will be keeping the Godfather around for awhile."
2,New Headway dvd elementary,"An excellent help in learning English.Funny scenes and best video quality,english subtitles optional.Great.New Headway"
2,Their greatest hits in one DVD,"I missed Maurice White, but I think the band is sounding as good and as powerful as ever. I think the dancers could have been ommited (this probably is one addition from their Las Vegas show, and don't get me wrong, the girls are beautiful and good dancers but unnecessary), and the ego of Philip Bailey minimized (just look at him and you will know what I mean) to leave room for other members to shine. My kids have listened to their music for years but now that they have seen them, they like EWF more. Great production, great sound, you will enjoy it and dance along."
2,LET'S GROOVE!,"EWF fans will truly enjoy this DVD! The overall production quality is top notch, the audio is great, and it is visually appealing. It has the look and feel of a very intimate performance. I think the editing was great. Rather than a lot of quick cuts and panning of the audience, the focus is on the performers for the most part. Also, unlike another reviewer, I felt that the dancers (which were used sparingly) added a visual element that enhanced those particular songs. And, with the exception of ""Shining Star"", which was a bit altered, all the other songs were true to their original recordings. The bottom line is that this is a very entertaining DVD and would be cherished by any EWF fan!"
2,A most highly recommended resource,"While this book seems largely unknown in the Reiki community, it is a most wonderful resource. It really does help understand the process of living in the moment and feeling the energetic effects of simply being.The author describes the journey that this book represents not as being a ""how-to"" guide for Reiki, but as a ""why-to."" Narrin truly feels that Reiki cannot be adequately described, and therefore she leaves that to the reader to find their own Reiki experience. Thus, the book is left to be a journey into understanding the tangible, real-life benefits of approaching life holistically and with intention.I strongly reccomend this book to everyone, not just Reiki practitioners. It will honestly enrich our human experience. Jus the author's personal story related in the book is wonderful, and it is so nice to see a Reiki book that isn't regurgitating the same information as every other."
2,Great Tasting Protein Bar,"I have this bar with a cup of coffee as well. It's a great tasting protein bar, that goes well with any diet..very filling, and bigger then most of the other brand bars out there."
2,"It's my ""handbook""","Mars and Venus on a Date is the first John Gray book I've read. Having been widowed a year and a half and being back in the world of dating, I found that this book was very helpful to find the kind of relationship I'm looking for. There were so many parts of the book that I wanted to refer to, I got out my yellow highlighter, and now view this book as a sort of 'handbook' of dating. I have a better understanding of how men think, and how women think, and the mistakes many women (myself included) seem to make in an effort to find their ""soul mate."" I highly recommend this book to anyone who just don't seem to be getting anywhere in the world of love."
2,Valuable Info.,"John Gray offers some important information that can be overlooked in men/women relationships. In this ""PC"" world we live in it isn't polite to say that men and women are different, but we are. And this book has some interesting insights into our differences. It has helped me to not take it so personal when men say and do (or don't say or do as the case may be) things that can be offensive. This book helps me to forgive and love the men in my life."
2,I wish I read this book 15 years ago!!,"I have always fought the idea that men and women are inherently different and for the longest time refused to read any of John Grey's books. However, dating someone I thought ""was perfect for me"" for only a couple of months, I found myself going through yet another hurtful breakup. Wondering what I could have done differently, I found this book in a bookstore and began browsing through it. To my suprise, I found this speaking to exactly what I should have known all along! Now, about to turn 40 and still single, I find myself giving alot of this advice to my college-age neices. Im on-line ordering it for them now -- so they don't have to go through the same experiences of looking for Prince Charming the same way I did."
2,"A good, practical guide for dating","It's funny how there are so many books out there written for men to teach them how to win over a woman while dating her, yet not many books written for couples who want to have a meaningful dating experience that could lead to so much more. Thankfully a trusted relationship espert, John Gray, wrote one. I've enjoy and benefited from John's books for years. This one was no exception. I really appreciated how he explained the ""stages"" couples go through while dating. It takes away confusion and fear of the future. While my partner hasn't read the book, I have applied what John suggests to our relationship. I am much more at peace and am enjoying myself much more than I did when I was constantly worried about where my relationship was going and if I should brace myself for disappointment."
2,A time honored classic,"I am a Mars Venus Counselor in the Boston area. I teach it, I know it, I love it, but the real story is that people who have read this and other Mars Venus books find amazing relevancy in John Gray's ability to share his wisdom. In Mars & Venus on a Date, you have established guidelines that WILL help you to be successful. Enjoy!"
2,"Very insightful, but...","This book was very insightful in many areas, but it seemed to have a lot of repetition. Also, Dr. Gray failed to give any mention or acknowlegement toward interracial and intercultural relationships. (I am a white male dating an asian female, BTW.)Aside from that, Dr. Gray did an excellent job. For guys, I also strongly recommend ""Women: Maxim's Unauthorized Guide."" I don't think it's available here, but if you mix Dr. Gray with the writers of Maxim Magazine, you really can't go wrong. Best of luck!"
2,5 stages worth learning,"I believe Dr. Gray wants people to better understand the differences between men and women, how we react to situations differently and how to accept these differences. Take from this book what you like and discard what you find not applicable to your situation. Gray uses many generalizations that I did not agree with but I still found the book worth reading."
2,A guide,This is a great guide to help narrow down the possibilities. It has great insight and I found it to be very helpful.
2,"Great Read, Words that Stick With Me",Glad I got this and read it- over a decade to start up again. Solid ideas that have stuck with me. It is a great aid in setting the stage for things to work. And great details on how men and women work differently. Highly recommend this for anyone of any age who is out there trying!
2,Insightful,"The book is well laid out and provides wonderfully insightful information and ""food for thought"". Think this can help most people with understanding their relationships past and present"
2,Best band on planet earth,I saw this Live By Request concert on A&E in 1999 when it first aired. I saw EWF in concert in September and what a show. Just wanted a little more of that live action. It's great!!!!
2,Earth Wind and Fire - Live by request review,As usual it's really good entertainment by E W and Fire. Any one who loves E. W and Fire music should have this DVD and will not have any regrets.
2,UNREAL!!!!!!!!!!,"Long-time die-hard EWF fan. I have done their music live, there is no greater musical high. This is a superbly produced DVD. The arrangements take EWF to the highest levels yet. Musicanship (although not all-original band) is awesome. Sound and video technology is near perfect. If all my favorite bands did this quality of DVD production, I would never get anything done."
2,Enjoyable Reading,I am always looking for books that I can read and not have to experience bad language or explicit sex scene. This book fit into my requirements for clean entertaining reading.
2,Laura Antonelli,"Bought this for Laura's appearance. Was not disappointed. Disliked the male lead, had no sympathy for the actor's character. The teen daughter was delicious."
2,Memories of a war hero,"A gripping memoir of a Vietnam Forward Air Controller (FAC) that dramatically describes what it's like to fly low and slow over the jungle in a light plane that's vulnerable to fire from anything bigger than a slingshot. Elser, a highly decorated pilot, tells the story without ever bragging. Addressed to his son, the memoir goes on to tell what happens later in life, when combat becomes a frightening memory tinged with guilt and remorse. How Elser resolves the conflicts and describes ""what's it all about"" is a memorable and worthwhile read."
2,A very important book on ancient India,Challenges old notions regarding ancient Indian history and makes a powerful case for a new view based on new archaeology and literary analysis. A MUST BUY for any lover of Indian history!
2,Absolutely exquisite,"I loved this film. It was funny and sad and everything a good movie should be. Its definitely a keeper. Emma was fantastic and so was the rest of the cast. Kate was wonderful in it. If you're a fan of Kate or Emma or Hugh or just want to see a great movie, this is definitely a great one to see!!"
2,A touching picture of romance,"I have long been a fan of Jane Austen's work but have found that many of the films made that were adapted from her novels were not as quality as I would have expected them. However, I was pleasantly surprised to find that Sense and Sensibility was not typical of the other films. Emma Thompson did an excellent job of writing the screenplay and playing in the movie. This is a classic romance story that will give you the sensation of falling in love over and over again each time you watch it. The film is timeless, the acting superb, and the story unforgettable."
2,"British accents, period costume, love, marriage,deceipt","Emma Thompson again gives a great performance as a pre-Victorian woman of great common sense. Kate Winslet portrays her sister, who allows her heart rule her life. The life situations that play out for these two ladies provide humor, sorrow, and a lesson in life in their time."
2,the good definetly outweighs the questionable,"Okay, so ELinor was supposed to be 19 and Brandon only 35. Emma Thompson fudged with the ages a little. So what? If I was Emma Thompson and over 19 and writing this screenplay I would do so myself. There were a couple of times, I grant you, that I did wish that Elinor was being played by a younger actress. But only a couple of times and I have watched this movie more times than I care to report. And Alan Rickman was over 35 but he's ALAN RICKMAN and he provided a beautiful portrayl of Colonel Brandon. As for Ms. Thompson's alterations and additions they were for the most part not only neccessary for a screen adaptation but delightful and on reading the book I missed the scene about the atlas. Ms. Thompson's writing is quite charming and a delightful companion to the book."
2,I love this movie,"This movie transports me.I highly recommend it to Jane Austen fans,who love her language, her stories, her humor.There are many lessons to be explained to a son or daughter in this film.A must see."
2,One of the best movies,"With a such a cast as this, who could have expected anything but sucess for this movie. Emma Thompsen is absolutely charming! And for all you HOuse fans out there, it's another side of that man who plays that grummpy character. I really love this film!!!"
2,Sense & Sensibility: A Wonderful Movie,"If you like period pieces and happy endings, this is the movie for you. Sense and Sensibility has always been a favorite of mine. The cast is wonderful and Alan Rickman as the gentle and lonely Colonel Brandon is one of his best roles. Emma Thompson and Hugh Grant make for a lovely couple as Elenor and Edward. Sense and Sensibility will make you laugh and cry. A great movie!"
2,The ONE movie I'd choose if I had to choose ONE,"I've seen a lot of movies--read even more books. There's something about this film that makes me want to see it again and again and each time, it's as brilliant as the first and I end it with tears streaming down my face. It's a completely successful adaptation of Jane Austin's story. Emma Thompson's wit and ""sensibility"" shines. The acting is supurb and I have already turned my young daughters into fans. Don't miss this wonderful film."
2,Anything by Jane,My favorite movie of ALL TIME!! Anything by Jane Austin is wonderful and Emma Thompson did a wonderful adaptation of this story.
2,Sense and Sensibility.,"Well, I haven't watched it yet, but my wife watched it right as soon as she could. She loved it of course. Been looking all over for a copy of it for her. Arrived quickly and in great shape. Thanks."
2,excellent purchase,excelente compra no podría estar más feliz!!!/excellent purchase could not be happier!
2,Timeless adaptation of a classic,"This is a near-perfect film adaptation of one of Jane Austen's classic novels; my only criticism is that Emma Thompson is rather old to be portraying a 19-year-old girl. Despite that, she does an incredible job with the part, as do all the actors in this movie. Alan Rickman's Colonel Brandon makes me swoon every time I watch it. The direction is lovely - every scene is like a painting, with beautiful landscapes, set design, and costumes. I had to buy a second copy on Blu-Ray because I wore out my original DVD."
2,Great movie!,"This is an overall wonderful movie. Unlike Mansfield Park, it stays more true to Jane Austen's story, and it doesn't try to sugarcoat the situation of women in that era. These women are smart, interesting, and as independent as they can be in their society. The acting is superb. The movie is a perfect adaptation of the book."
2,Absolutely Brilliant!,"This film is absolutely brilliant! There is not much more to say! Emma Thompson and Kate Winslet give magnificent performances! The storyline was written beautifully. It is witty, endearing, sad and triumphant all at the same time throughout the entire movie! You can't help but fall in love with all the heroic characters and come to despise the dishonest ones. And the director, Ang Lee, did an amazing job of capturing the story through such a simple and understated way, yet it hardly comes across the film that way! I recommend this film to anyone who loves a good storyline with a plot and brilliant acting!"
2,"For once, a movie that is actually as good as the book","Ang Lee has done a magnificent job of bringing Jane Austen's ""Sense and Sensibility"" to the screen. The acting, directing and screenplay are terrific. Emma Thompson is wonderful as Elinor Dashwood and Greg Wise is excellent as the heartbreaker Willoughby. I've always had a problem with the character of Marianne; she is so ridiculous that you just want to slap some sense into her; but Kate Winslet's memorable performance actually makes her more sympathetic than she appears in the book. With all the great acting by the lead and supporting cast, the picture is stolen by Hugh Grant, who is absolute perfection as the bumbling Edward Ferrars. The movie more than does justice to the book; Jane Austen would be proud."
2,Sense & Sensibility,"Great work of Emma Thompson...loved her changes to make this movie come alive. Loved that Ang Lee directed this movie, that someone from a diferrent cultural upbringing could understand Jane Austen. All of the acting was superb...my favorite movie of all time."
2,A delight,"If you like period films, wonderful heroes (some dashing, but flawed - others not so dashing, but true!) and intelligent heroines. You will enjoy this film.Ms. Thompson's adaption is great. A few bad ""guys"", wonderful good ""guys"" and a happy and tidy ending. The acting is first rate - from the main characters to supporting. If you purchase this film, you will not be dissappointed!"
2,Very enjoyable story.,"Sometimes you just need a good story (although old fashioned) and a lovablehero and heroine. I love Emma, Kate and Alan Rickman anyway!"
2,Durable and subtle,"It's extremely difficult to write something different than what already appears here about this extraordinary film, other than to reinforce the nuances which make it so fine.Yes, it's the acting; it's the painstaking detail in the costumes, jewelry, scenery; it's the tight script and poetic pace; it's all of these things, and yet what makes this movie so wonderful is not minutia but evocation. Whether you identify with the idealism of Winslet's Marianne or the endurance found in Thompson's Elinor, we all know -- intimately -- the range of emotions which this terrific group of artists seem to so effortlessly touch with words and deeds.It's a stunning piece, I have yet to meet someone unaffected by it. Share this movie with someone you love."
2,Absolutely Wonderful!,"The thing that surprised me most about this wonderful film was Alan Rickman's subtly sweet performance. Those who do not fall immediately in love with Hugh Grant's stammering charmer Edward Ferrars, will certainly find themselves drawn in by Rickman's heartbreaking Col. Brandon. Don't let the ""chick-flick"" title fool you, this is a terrific movie."
2,not just a girl movie,"I really like 'pride and prejudice'. I loved how tiny the events of all the characters were against the landscapes. In sense and sensibility I found those same enveloping landscapes. I only picked up this movie because of two reasons. I've already named the first and the second was because of Ann Lee's direction. He handles his films to my tastes. I have enjoyed nearly all of his films. The acting in this film is high, and it has a unique feel that is opposite of what is out today, even of Pride and Prejudice. I felt that the characters of Sense so refreshing to watch. I really like how hugh grant and emma thompson played. It's because of how they acted that this film is far more than a period piece."
2,Quality film,"The kind of movie that I like to add to my library collection because of the life style, manners, etc. that I want my family to emulate."
2,Absolutely Beautiful!!,"This is one of my all-time favorite films. Everything about it is just superb, from the gorgeous scenery to the clever script to the perfect casting of every role. I could never tire of watching this, it has a deep appeal to the romantic in me.I dare say it will do the same for anyone who loves romance and has an imagination. Ahhh, if only there could be a sequel!! But it IS hard to outdo perfection!"
2,IF YOU LIKE JANE AUSTEN MOVIES,"I love Jane Austen, I love well-done 19th Century Brit Lit classic productions. The actors are fun...Emma Thompson, as always, is superb and Hugh Grant, of course, is the bad boy one just loves to hate. This movie is really multi-purpose: a great way to spend some time if you are home with the sniffles, a great escape on what might be the end of an all too modern day, or just cozy to watch curled up by the fire.Definitely worth owning...sort of a ""little black dress"" DVD. ENJOY!"
2,Sense and Sensibilty Movie,"Of all the movies I have seen about Sense and Sensibility this is by far the best!! Emma Thompson did a superb job of writing the screenplay. She followed Jane Austen's book almost as it was written. She even included the third child which all other screen players did not. I do not know why some screen players think their script is better then the author's story, but they do. Buy the movie."
2,A hopeless romantic's English delight!,"This is (in my opinion) the finest of all movies based on Jane Austen novels. An extremely fine cast and beautiful English settings, along with Emma Thompson's beautifully written screenplay make for a fine evening for all hopeless romantics! This is a story of two sisters who lose their dowry due to their father's death and all the money goes to his first son. Elinor's sensibility is contrasted against Marianne's (superbly played by Kate Winslet) lack of sense in pursuit of romance as each girl endures various obstacles pertaining to the objects of their affections. Each sister endures and grows to find the true love and happiness that they've always hoped for. The soundtrack is also an asset to this movie."
2,Worth owning just for the audio commentary!,My wife and I love this movie. I won't go into details about the movie itself; many others here have already done that quite adequately. Let me tell you what I like about this particular DVD release.I bought this when I realized it has been re-released with extras. (I believe the first outing was pretty much bare bones.)The audio commentary with Emma Thompson is more than worth the price of the movie. Absolutely hilarious. As is the clip of her speech at the Golden Globes - written as if penned by Jane Austen herself.We still haven't digested Ang Lee's commentary; but the disc is well worth the price so far.Buy it and enjoy! Thanks for reading.
2,A beautiful story well told!,"This is one of my all time favorite movies, it is most certainly a *classic*. The story of the Daschwood sisters' troubles are told so sweetly- the sisters love each other so much and want each to be happy. It is funny, too, Mrs. Jennings and Charlotte lighten up any person's day yet they also make you frustrated for Marianne and Elinor. The scenery and music in this film are lovely... they portray the spirit of the scene you are watching. This movie was what made me a Jane Austen fan. Immediately after watching S&S I read it and fell in love with Jane Austen. I think everyone should watch this movie, you will be touched!"
2,Love this movie,Such a great movie to watch at home and be taken into another time and place. Acting is wonderful and visually beautiful.
2,Touching,"Although I though Elinore looked too old for the part, she really reached the heart. Great acting. For a two hour rendition, this is the best."
2,My Favorite Movie,A movie classic that I can watch ( and do watch) over and over. The characters are all likable -even Mr. Parmer ( who became House!)
2,Sense and Sensibility,"Ang Lee's first Engish-language film, ""Sense"" is a vivid period drama, intelligent and involving, and benefitting from Austen's skewering of English social mores, gossip and materialism. Young Winslet is striking in a fiery, star-making turn, more than holding her own beside the gifted and appealing Thompson (who also wrote the screenplay-and got the Oscar for it)."
2,Excellent romance,"I'm not good at movie reviews, but this one is an excellent romance movie for a quiet night at home with your partner. Its one that can be watched over and over with enjoyment."
2,Sense & Sensibility,It got to me in good condition. I like the movie and am really glad I bought it. It is a nice love story with rally good actor's and actress. It is a movie to watch over and over again.
2,The Title Says it All,"This is another favorite of mine by Jane Austen The poignant and heartwrenching problems that most of the main characters incur throughout the movie provide a most enthralling and compelling story, yet in the end, the ""sensibility"" gained by the actors brings the tale to a magnificent and satisfying conclusion for all. Kate Winslet & Alan Rickman are my two favorites in this movie; they both give magnificent performances. I would reccomend this to anyone who enjoys true drama."
2,Another gem with Emma Thompson,Emma Thompson is truly an acting treasure. This particular film also demonstrates her superb writing skills. So great in fact it won her an oscar. Kate Winslet is demure and refreshing in one of her early performances. I've not been a fan of Hugh Grant but he plays very well here. Beautiful locations beautiful music and beautiful acting make this film another jewel in the crown of Emma Thompson. Highly recommended.
2,wonderful movie,"GiGi is such a wonderful classic musical. The songs, the costumes, the theme, is just great."
2,Walters GIGI DVD,"This is a classic Lerner and Lowe musical, elegantly produced,photographed, costumed, and acted. Maurice Chevalier and Louis Jourdan are the perfect foils for Hermione Gingold and Leslie Caron. The entire piece is a genuine delight, with music you can whistle for months! If you haven't tried it, listen to it in French - it is wonderful!"
2,Amazing Movie!,"This is an amazing movie. The Blue-ray looks awesome for something so old. The disc contains two versions of the movie, one is the older black and white version (which the quality isn't so great), and the slightly newer color version. I ordered this movie somewhat on accident, but it has quickly became one of my favorites!"
2,ahh.. for the love of french!,"I just love this little movie. Funny and so French. Audre Hepburn (sp?) wanted this roll but she was too old to play the part. The older gentleman that is in this movie later played the candlestick in Beauty and the Beast...you know... be our guest, be our guest... to our service to the test! My daughter loved to laugh at the young girl getting tipsey on the wine her Aunt is serving along with the quality time being spent playing cards and poking fun at each other."
2,End of a lovely era,"Minnelli's best works and it deserved the nine Academy awards for sure. The Blu Ray version is crystal clear and brings the beauty of this film to life like never before, almost feels like a live performance. The added features are worth the price of the disk alone, especially the enlightening and charming interviews with Leslie Caron. Awful shame they stopped making these beautiful musicals, although I would imagine the cost would be too prohibitive today. Unlike ""An American in Paris"" ( another favorite of mine ) this film was actually made in Paris and it is almost a travelogue in itself, the scenes and costumes are absolutely are stunning. I would recommend this addition to anyone's collection who enjoys a bit of romance and happiness."
2,ginger,"We have loved this movie since it came out, so we were very happy to find a DVD in very good shape at a reasonable price. We will be shopping here more often."
2,classic classic.,"i love gigi. it's one of my all time favs. love the stories, love paris, love the actors, love the clothes. great show!"
2,BRAVISIMO,"This movie is a must see! Caron and Chevalier are dynamic together. Thank Heaven for Little Girls and for this Masterpiece. For ""old movie"" buffs, this is one to add to your collection."
2,Just what I expected,Enjoyed the interviews with cast. The black and white Gigi was available. All came as expected quickly and with no problem. Well packed with a second video I ordered.
2,This is a great movie!,"I loved GIGI. It was witty, entertaining and endearing! Gigi's character developed well and I loved the songs! Gigi had moral substance and was trully a delight to watch!"
2,Charming and lovely,"This film is quite charming. It's beautifully shot on location in Paris. Leslie Caron is lovely, too; she looks so different than in An American in Paris! And she gives a good performance. Maurice Chavalier is clearly having the time of his life, espicially in the first scene, and is wonderful. So is the aunt; she's pretty funny. The lavish costumes and sets are great. ""thank heaven for little girls"" and ""i remember it well"" are the best songs, though they probably aren't as good as others in the Lerner&Loewe canon. The last great MGM musical; if you see it, you'll see why."
2,A personal Favorite!,I've been watching this movie since I was a little girl and I could watch it over and ver again every day. It's a very touching story!
2,"Aw yes, i remember it well.","I'm a sap for old musicals. I own most of them and have been in several during my life.When it comes to ""Gigi"" the best way to discribe it is fairy tale of innocent love. This is a wonderful musical with ageless songs. Songs that you'll remember as a kid and songs that will you hum after the movie is over. If you happen to have a 5.1 sound system it will be even more of a thrill. The sound on this DVD is like hearing it in a theatre that had magnetic Stereo Sound System. IT IS FLAWLESS. This movie is also headed by a wonderful talented cast of likes that will not ever grace the screen again. Pop the popcorn, open a can of soda, dim the lights and relax to one of our greatest screen musicals ever made."
2,Emptiness in the Mind Only School,"Hopkins guides us through difficult terrain with an expertise that confers a clear sense of direction and a deeper understanding of The Essence of Eloquence.See the companion volumes:Reflections on Reality: The Three Natures and Non-Natures in the Mind-Only School: Dynamic Responses to Dzong-ka-ba's The Essence of Eloquence, Volume 2andAbsorption in No External World: 170 Issues in Mind Only Buddhism (Dynamic Responses to Dzong-Ka-Ba's the Essence of Eloquence)"
2,a new GIGI?,"i'm surprised to see that a new release of Gigi Blu-ray is coming in february, 2010. i'm wondering how this is different from the one already out If anyone has any info i'd apreciate a response. Thanks!"
2,amazon.com ROCKS!!!!!!,This is the first product I bought on line and it was so easy. I love using Amazon.com.
2,Nice oldie,"I watched this movie only because i got it and some other movies cheap.While the costumes were great and the acting fine,i couldn't help but feel the story lacked a good plot.I kept bringing comparisons with My Fair Lady,i loved that movie,and the music was good also.But in this i kind of felt it was not quite up to that.I ended up getting a little bored with it.It was a rather long movie.But i do like to watch movies from this era,so i'm glad i saw it."
2,Delightful Leslie,"The first time I saw this movie - several years ago - I was not very impressed. But now, today, it appeals to me much more. I can appreciate it upon 2nd or 3rd or 4th viewing. It is definitely worth having in one's collection. Leslie Caron is a fine little actress, and her leading man is very believeable as the filthy-rich, bored-with-life snob. UNTIL he tangles with sweet, funny, gay, enchanting Gigi. She softens him, falls in love with him, and when she blossoms from a giddy schoolgirl into a charming, alluring adult (teen-ager?), with the help of her grandmother and sophisticated aunt, his eyes are opened, he is definitely hooked, and all ends well. ""But it, you'll like it!""I would have given it a 5-star rating but for the fact I thought there's a bit too much of Maurice Chevalier in it.P.S. - It does offer English subtitles. Maybe French too, I don't remember. (The plot is laid in France.)"
2,One of my favorites,"Having gotten very interested in Jane Austen lately, I watched this movie once again last week. I have owned it on VHS for about 13 years. It is, and always will be one of my favorite movies of all time. It has beautiful outdoor scenes, beautiful dialogue and superb acting. Time to get the DVD!"
2,A True Masterpiece,"This is without a doubt one of the most moving and beautiful films I have ever seen. The irony is kept at a perfect level, so the film is neither too ""sweet"" nor too cynical. The acting is as good as it gets. Especially Emma Thompson gives a performance that touches your heart."
2,A Timeless Story,"Every time I see S&S I find another line or look or gesture that I missed or overlooked on a previous viewing. This film is filled with wonderful nuances, simplicity, real emotion. For example, the looks on Elinor's face when she thinks that her beloved is engaged and she must keep the secret or when she thinks he got married...those looks break your heart. The last 20 minutes of this movie are about the most perfect 20 minutes of any film I've seen. Beautiful acting from all parties - witty insightful dialogue - not over the top or overdone in any sense of the word."
2,A Classic Masterpiece - truly beautiful,"A Classic Masterpiece - truly beautiful. This is honestly my favorite movie. It is truly a masterpiece. Words cannot express how beautiful I think this movie is. It is so moving and is such a beautiful--LOVE story. You really learn what TRUE LOVE is when you finish watching this movie. I never tire of it, and have watched it over and over. It is uplifting. Guarantee you will shed at least one tear at the end - it is so moving. Everyone should own a copy of this movie.(P.S. Don't forget to buy the Soundtrack - it is so beautiful to listen to!!! You'll love it too!!)"
2,Pleasant movie for Jane Austen fans. Sound not high enough.,"I enjoyed the movie very much but, as with a couple of other movies I have purchased from Amazon, I have a bit of a problem hearing the dialogue of the movie, even after trying it on 3 different TVs/DVD players. I recommend the movie, though for Jane Austen fans. I just wish the sound was better."
2,It's the best movie I have ever seen!,"I watch it over and over again! I beg for it every Christmas and my birthday. Love it, love it , love it!"
2,Definitely a family favorite!,"Except for the fact that I can't stand the way the Victorians beat around the bush about everything and rarely speak their mind in a plain and straightforward manner, our whole family just loves this movie. Wonderful actors and actresses portraying interesting characters and a wonderful story where, for the most part, everyone has a happy ending (except the guy that felt that money was more important than true love - and he realized his mistake, in the end)."
2,Important Milestone,"An interesting read from both a doctrinal as well as historical perspective. Issued in 1947, the encyclical focuses on the preservation and nature of the liturgy - including the mass, the hours, devotionals and sacraments. Interestingly, many of the examples used by Pius XII in the encyclical, such as going to a ""primative"" original eucharistic celebration, the return to the ""table"" style altar, elimination of Gregorian chant, the use of the vernacular and similar items were, within 20 years, adopted by the Church as part of the Vatican II reforms. The encyclical discusses the symbolism of the liturgy at length as well as parctice and customs. A good historical milestone that presages the Vatical II reforms."
2,"Yes, there are Jews in Knoxville!","This is a delightful history of the small, but growing and ever present Jewish community of Knoxville, including Oak Ridge. Ms. Besmann's book is not only enjoyable for those of us who have been connected with this community over the years, and know many of the individuals she writes about, it is also for anyone interested in the history of this beautiful southern city. ""A Separate Circle: Jewish Life in Knoxville, Tennessee"" is an affirmation that where ever Jewish roots are sown, significant contributions are made to the community as a whole."
2,"No problems, here","I've had my Samsung 1GB player for about 2 months now and have had no problems with it as some other people have mentioned here.I don't use OGG files since I really don't see any benefit to them (other than not having to pay a license fee for use of the OGG codec) and instead use 320kbps mp3 files, managing to get at least 6 hours total of playing time off of each playlist I download. It handles large files (over 10mb) with no problem at all and since I listen to a lot of jazz and classical music, it suits my needs perfectly.As far as the radio is concerned, I don't listen to the radio anymore so this isn't an issue for me, either. I also recommend getting the Sony MDR-EX71 earbuds for great sound since the stock buds the Samsung comes with are sub par.If you are looking for a small player for your commuting needs, I fully recommend the Samsung. Hopefully they'll come out with a 2GB player in the near future since I'll be the first in line to purchase one."
2,Overall Great - Durable,I've had this MP3 player for a about 2 months. My initial impression was that it was a great player. Very small with a nice screen. I thought I would have problems with the battery door but that has not been the case. I've dropped this player off the treadmill at least five times and it keeps on ticking. My only complaint so far is that the player menu system bogs down while playing VBR WMA files.
2,Great little player -- bookmarking would make it perfect,The only thing I wish this player had was a way to set bookmarks during playback. I downloaded several large WMA audio books and they play great. The only thing is if you are not careful you can nudge the joystick too far to the left or right and then you are forced to start the book over from the beginning. I like the flexibility of haveing an FM radio and voice recording. The sound quality is excellent and I haven't even messed with the EQ. The AA battery really does last a long time -- probably close to the 40 hours promised. I don't really miss the option of a belt clip or wrist band. The player is so tiny it is easy to slip into my pocket. When I am jogging I just hold it in my hand; the removable plastic cover protects it from sweat.
2,great,I remember years ago watching this on TV. This is so much better in widescreen and HD. I love it.
2,GIGI Leslie Caron on Blue Ray,"GIGI - Every bit as good as the first time I saw it (The original release i 1958) The extra material (B & W) was very interesting.Oldies, like me, will enjoy the music."
2,"""Gigi"" shines like no other musical","Gigi, played wonderfully by Leslie Caron, perfectly illustrates a girl's coming-of-age. As she transforms into a beautiful young lady, it is hard for us to recognize her. However, following though Caron's realistic transformation, we can relate to Caron. Furthermore, Gaston also represent everyone's ideal husband - both friend and lover."
2,Great performance by Kate Winslet,"Good movie, but I recommend you read Jane Austen's book Sense and Sensibility first. The movie is not exactly like the book , but still enjoyable. I enjoyed Kate Winslet's performance. I thought Emma Thompson was too old to play this role..she's supposed to be 19 yrs old in the book, she looks like she can be Kate Winslet's mother. Hugh Grant does a great job playing Edward Ferrars. Overall a very good movie."
2,Great movie!,"This particular movie is one I have watched over and over. I don't ever get tired of this version. I have seen others and they didn't have the cast that made this edition so wonderful. It's a movie for years of entertainment and just joyful to watch. It's funny, poignant, sad and best of all, happy endings!!!!"
2,A Review of my order of Sense & Sensiblity,"I received the product in a very quick amount of time. The actors in this movie were great,especially the three main actors.The story was well done and done with excellent attention to detail and in good taste. Emma Thompson Always does a great perfomance of her roles. It is always a treat to watch an expert at work!"
2,Great Movie,I watch it over and over. I think all the actors are great. Very close to the book. Read the book then watch the movie.
2,Another Argeneau Man to wish for!,I started reading the series and I accidently reversed the 2nd and 1st book up but going into the third was a smooth transition. I've read the first 7 of these books and they all flow from one book to the next. They are sensual as well as humorous. I could almost feel the pain as Lucian reluctly agrees to things but that's what makes the story so capitivating. I'm sure once I've completed the entire series I'll be ready for more from the Argeneau family. Lydsay could keep these stories going on forever for this mixed up vampire extented family.
2,Surly man brings laughter,This story is once again a great tale with real life characters who struggle with the same embarrassing situations we do
2,A fun set of interactions evolves,"Lyndsay Sands' SINGLE WHITE VAMPIRE receives a fine spirited performance by Jeffrey Cummings, a stage actor who lends an avid voice to this funny drama about a publishing editor's involvement with an author whose vampire romances are becoming a hit. A fun set of interactions evolves. A fine pick for any lending library."
2,what a side-splitting fun read,"I think I hurt from laughing after I finished this. I bought it ages ago, but kept putting it aside. The cover was just so bland. I finally reached the bottom of my TBR stack and there is still was. Now I am sorry I put it off so long.I adore Lucern! What a grumpy sexy vampire. Him in the supermarket wanting to bite the steak was brilliant!Highly recommended for someone who needs a smile on their face.Cannot wait to read the rest in this series."
2,Lucern's Lifemate,"Single White Vampire is yet another mindblowing Lynsay Sands book. Lucern is being annoyed but his new editor to do some publicity but can hardly do TV when he needs blood, avoids sunlight and of course doesn't age. How long can he keep his new publisher and her co-workers in the dark? And how long can he deny his attraction to her a thirst he hasn't felt for centuries.Lynsay Sands does it again."
2,BETTER THAN PROZAC....,This is the most side spliting humor and good vamp series I have ever read. Do not Miss The Argeneau Vampires @ friends. I sometimes wonder If I am disturbing my neighbors with my late at night Laughter that seems to come from Nowhere... A Must Read as are all of Lindsay Sands books.
2,"Really, really good.",I like vampire stories that aren't the usual run of the mill bloodsucking fiends. That's why this book was such a hit with me. It's got a sense of humor. The story flowed really well and it's an easy read. I am checking out more in this series.
2,Great Book!!,"Great book, excellent series. Very inventive, and not your typical ""vampire romance"".Loved the whole series! Read them each several times."
2,Great book fun to read!,I enjoyed reading this book. Doesn't go into a great depth but is enough to keep you stimulated.
2,This is a nice card guard.,"I have 2 of these card guards (""All In"" & ""The Nuts"") and they are both great products, they look nice on BOTH sides. One side is just more flashy. If you like to use card guards then you will be happy this any one from this line."
2,A comprehensive book on cosmetics,"I am currently studying the development of consumer product manufacturing processes, and borrowed the book from the library to get a good feel of the subject. To my satisfaction, I found this book containing important pieces of information suitable for general readers as well as for experts in cosmetics science. The first section describes different aspects of cosmetics, including usage, processing, and even sources of information such as journals and websites. The second part deals with various cosmetic products in great detail. It provides a very systematic discussion on cosmetics ingredients, nicely classified according to their function, which is very useful for those trying to understand the logic behind cosmetic formulation. It also describes the typical equipment for cosmetic production, although not in detail. In summary, I really think this is the book to read if you are interested in cosmetics formulation and processing."
2,Good Value,"Easy to use, good value, great pics. Spent a lot of time looking at higher priced cameras that were no better. Wished the AC adapter were included in package."
2,Great anyway you slice it.,This camera is a great first ditigal camera for anyone. It takes great pictures. Is easy to use. Very affordable. Sends pictures easily to your e-mail addresses. Has a built in lens cover. Can be used with 2 AA batteries. And is compatible with most ditigal printers.
2,Fuji A340,"Good average pix taker, but dated. It fits a niche here. Is strong enough to take mild shocks, bumps."
2,Fairly Good Book,"This book is representative of Ruth White's former books upon chakras and spirit guides. This book gives a basic review of the chakras systems and goes in depth about contacting your own spirit guides. White provides useful exercises for meeting your spirit guide, such as vision techniques, meditation techniques, and the proper questions to ask your guide.If you enjoyed White's previous books, this one should not disappoint."
2,Great Read!,"I found this at my local bookseller and read it thinking it was the first in the series because under the title it states ""the book that started it all!"" Well, i was disappointed when i learned it was actually #3. The book itself was an awesome read. I love the characters of Kate and Luc and the storyline, while not adventurous, was well thought out. I did enjoy the blood bank scene! I look forward to reading the other books in this series!"
2,first book by this author,WELL I HAVE TO SAY THIS IS MY FIRST BOOK BY LYNSAY SANDS. MY HUSBAND PICKED IT UP FOR ME AND WELL I WILL BE LOOKING FOR MORE BY THIS AUTHOR. THIS WAS A GREAT BOOK. VERY ROMANTIC AND WELL VERY WELL WRITTEN. THE VAMPIRE IS NOT ANY KIND OF VAMPIRE NOT LIKE YOU NORMALLY READ. I DON'T WANT TO GIVE TO MUCH AWAY BUT THIS IS A NEED TO READ BOOK. MY HEART FELT FOR BOTH OF THEM. I ACTUALLY TINGLED.LOL... BUT GIVE THIS BOOK A SHOT YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED.
2,"Sex, Romance, and Vampires! What more do you need!!","I loved this book. I was hestitant to buy it because lately I have been comparing every vampire book/series to Charlaine Harris's series. Well, I read this book in one day. I now am actually looking for the other two books of Lynsay Sands called Love Bites, and Tall, Dark, and Hungry. These stories are about a vampire family that lives in Toronto. They have humor, sex, and romance in them. They also tell a little bit about how they became vampires. I wasn't disappointed."
2,Story of a Whim,I am always looking for books that I can read and not run into foul language when I turn the page.It's hard to delete a book that you have paid for and expect a good one.This book is lite and refreshing. Just some girls doing a random act of kindness.I really liked it. I can always be save with Grace Livingston Hill. Love her writings.
2,"A wonderful novella, true McCaffrey","This novella follows the life of Nerilka, a simple girl of Pern. It gives the reader a view of ordinary life on Pern, not the life of a weyrleader or a spectacular rider. Beautifully written"
2,A wonderful book!,I have told everyone I know to get this book as a starter to the world of Wabi-Sabi-- a beautiful cover also makes it lovely to look at and I like the sepia pages... I have re-examined my life using some of her practical tips. Get it if you are curious about this art of imperfection...
2,An essentially accurate and sympathetic book,"This is an essentially accurate and sympathetic book. Chafets for many years was a journalist at the 'Jerusalem Report' and followed what was happening in Israel very closely. He before that served as an Advisor to Prime Minister Begin. He is a writer who makes an effort to meet with people from all walks of life, escape the common cliches of the media, and provide his own special perspective.He provides an interesting look at Israeli society as it appeared nearly two decades ago."
2,THE TRUE AGE OF ROCK AND ROLL,"I own a copy of this great cd and listen to it every chance I get. Great music by the true creator of Rock & Roll. This is a must have cd for anyone who grew up istening and dancing to the music of Chuck Berry. Sounds great on home system,car system or portable cd player.Sweet Little Sixteen"
2,Biggest prision break EVER!,"This was a one-shot OVA by produced Production IG(Ghost In The Shell), and created by Gainax who did FLCL and Gurren Lagann. This was an original anime not based on any manga.Taking place in the distant future, two amensiac fugitives find themselves in the middle of the desert. After a quick crime spree, they're caught and sentenced to a prision on what's left of the moon. Once there, they team up with the other inmates to do the ultimate prision break. This leads to some amazingly cartoonish fight scenes. It's literally like a cross between Tom & Jerry and Quinton Tarentino. It leads up to a big battle, an immature pregnancy, and lots of explosions and violence.A censored version of Dead Leaves has been featured on Sci-Fi Channel's Ani-Monday, and a few other cable TV showings. It's a great sci-fi anime with quirky character designs, over-the-top action, and some serious reality-challenging physics!"
2,Tank Girl meets Fooly Cooly !!!,"this anime blew me away! the main characters pandy and retro remind me of tank girl and booga. the pace and energy level of the story are reminisent of the anime Fooly Cooly,but much more anarchic and intense,plus the humorous parts are great! Dead Leaves is not like your standard anime but for people willing to expand their perceptions of what Anime can be,I would say give this anime a try and be prepared to hang on tight!!"
2,My Son Loves It!!!,My son has been playing with this non stop for 2 days. He just keeps coming up with new ways to put it together. We haven't had any of the problems that other people have mentioned at all.
2,Good Set,"before Burning Cd's became all the rage these kind of Compilations were very essential in that they had a few songs that you had to have.""Let's Groove""""Call Me"" are just some of the songs that make this a cool Satuarday Night Party Set.if you just want your standard Radio Hits then this is for you."
2,"Good product, bad shipping",Arrived in no box/container or protective packaging. Some cosmetic damage. Battery is excellent for the price
2,Optima Bluetop battery,This item arrived damaged due to faulty packing job. I called Amazon and they promptly replaced the unit with no delays. Great customer service if you ask me.This is my 3rd Optima battery and I use it in my bass boat. It is very reliable and lasts a long time.
2,Single White Vampire,"This book is one of a series and they are all really good books. The author did a wonderful job in how she portrayed the Vampires, what an imagination she has. I look forward for more."
2,A quircky tale I couldn't put down!,Talk about funny! Lynsay Sands is a hilarious writer. I enjoyed every crazy moment. She has a way with writing that leaves you laughing out loud and ready for more! I started with this book and now own all three in the series. I am awaiting her new book coming out in November. Watch out- you'll be hooked!
2,just love this book,once again they get their life mate.. and as always I just love Lynsay Sands sense of humour... a great read
2,Oh my heavens!,"I was laughing so hard I scared the kitten. I have not enjoyed a book this much in a while, and I read ALOT. It took me all of 7 1/2 hours to finish. I just could not stop reading it. I don't just recommend this book, I HIGHLY recommend it to anyone!"
2,"Nice design, but too small!","The new pink/purple leapster has a nicer design than the old version. I like the new pen holder on the front. The arrow dial on the left side is better than the older (round)version, too. HOWEVER, we are exchanging it for the older version. The reason: THE SCREEN! The new leapster's screen measures only 5.4 cm - the old version screen measures 7 cm. Also, the pen on the new leapster is smaller. Customer service said everything on the new design is smaller ""to accomodate smaller hands""...that's nice, but it also requires better fine motor skills - which smaller hands do not necessarily have. For those of you who purchase this and are considering the recharging kit - I was told that this design needs the L-max recharger."
2,Excellent addition to the long history of Crewel,"Judy has added her own style and creativity to the ongoing tradition of crewelwork. She has used the various stitches in ways that are new and really guides the embroiderer to create beautiful crewel pieces. She hasn't just reworked the traditional stitches, but shows how to combine them in unique ways with modern colors and materials. She has ""raised the bar"" in the art of crewelwork. An excellent book for beginner and advanced crewelworker alike."
2,Fun AND Educational!!,"My daughter wanted a Leapster for Christmas. I wasn't sure which was the newer model, the triangular one or the smaller, rectangular one. So, I bought both to try them out. Screen size was also an issue for me. I thought the larger screen would be better. But, believe me, the newer version (small, retangular) Leapster's screen is sooo much clearer, crisper, and the colors are more vivid! My 4 year old daughter has no problem manipulating the buttons or the pen and SHE loves it! She plays it all the time. Now, my 7yo son, who has a GB Adv. SP wants one, too!"
2,Excellent learning tool,My 6 year old daughter just got the Leapster Learning System for Christmas yesterday and she loves it.She has not put it down since she got it. It has alot of games built into it so don't buy any extra cartridges until you see what it already has. I bought her 2 cartridges that it already has on it.
2,Widow should come to Japan,I have listened to both their demo album and current Midnight Strikes album. They play very progressive solos with dark feelings behind the music. I believe there is a new album coming up soon. This is a MUST for the fans out there... The sound (neo-classical and heavy metal) will definitely be a great hit in Europe and Japan. All my friends here in Japan loves them!
2,AT DAWN WE WAGE WAR!,"Zombie Apocalypse feature members of the extreamly talented american hardcore band shai hulud. However, they leave behind the technical complexity of the latest hulud offering for a blistering fast and feirce no nonsense sound. Just like any Hulud song, the short and sweet songs found on ""this is a spark of life"" are injected with huge amounts of passion and sincerity. And when i say short and sweet i mean SHORT AND SWEET! So dont expect and epics. The lyrics are great to scream along to and there is a general rising of the undead theme to the whole cd. So i challange you not to sit quietly and let the zombies eat your brain without a fight, AT DAWN WE WAGE WAR!!"
2,Sometimes What You're Looking for You Already Have,"My wife and I lost our beloved dog recently. We were loaned this book by a close friend in hopes it would help us, it has. We have been amazed at how some one else has the same love for dogs that we share. It has helped us let go of some of the pain and focus on all that he taught and shared with us. This is a book for all who love life and dogs."
2,Is there a perfect dog?,"While the professional reviewers might ""pan"" this particular short book, I would like to ""pick"" it.Shiebler presents the many dogs he has known with a heart touching poignancy. The dogs who shared his life are real, live, furry, and sometimes slobbery, to use his own adjective.As happens in life, many of he dogs Shiebler has known have died. Bring tissues. At least a dozen - or a couple of good strong cotton handkerchiefs - you will need them.If you know anyone who swears ""I never cry over stories"", bet them that A Search for the Perfect Dog will ruin their record. Provide tissues for them!"
2,obvioulsy the professional reviewers don't own dogs!!,"I have been looking for this book for a few years and finally found it here...I had lent it out and never got it back...This book touched me and I loved it so much I have refered people to it many times, in fact, I am writing this because I can't believe the negative reviews I read about one of my favorite books! I finally found the book and want to order a few to hand out.Read it...it captures how real dog lovers view dogs."
2,Quality equipment,"I received the plasma wall mount and was immediately impressed by the strength and quality. Every possible combination of nuts, screws, washers, and lags were included.Be sure to research your exact plasma model cause I ended up needing an additional adapter.I would buy a product again like this. Easy install, very sturdy and my plasma weighs 94 pounds....!"
2,Michele,"I have seen this documentary at the Pioneer Theater and at a film festival in Brooklyn. It is by far the best film dealing with the subject of 9/11. It is so beautifully shot with great interviews, great music; its stunning and emotional. It makes me proud to be a New Yorker."
2,Best Firesign performance ever BUT BEWARE...,"For those of you who know and loved this originally as an LP, you will be disappointed to learn that sony messed up the remix BIG TIME by deleting important dialog at the beginning of the second side of the album (of course, on the cd it would be the second segment). The beginning of the second side IS CRITICAL to the subject of the performance and as best as I can recall, should have begun something like this:""Welcome to side 4. Please follow along as we learn 3 new words in Turkish.Towel, Bath, Border...may I see your passport please..."" ...(someone could please tweak this for I know this is not EXACTLY the dialog).Anyway, you get the idea. The beginning is suppose to be as if you were listening to one of those ""Berlitz"" language records. Just wish/ hope sony would rectify this REAL SOON!"
2,I'm a Firesign made man,"I cut my young tongue on Firesign Theater back in the early 70s and have been speaking forkedly ever since. I believe it could rightly be said, these wizards of weirdness are the reason I am where I am today. Where is that, you may ask? Hmmmmm... What?"
2,Eastern Europe: Home of Your Inner Child!,"Oh - it's the Ice Show!The spy has been in deep cover behind the Iron Curtain. He has just received his hurried direction in clipped sentences, has checked into the Hotel Kafka, and has been intercepted, probed, scoffed at, ignored, and wiretapped.Then for no reason at all, he goes through a door, and is on the ice at the Berlibber Ice Palatz, to see the Gunatzis Brothers, Hans and Junni, shoot it out with weapons of increasing caliber and fierceness...It was their first album, and thus one of their more transparent. But side two (sorry, Side Five), remains a masterpiece."
2,A very good start,"The Firesign Theatre released their first album in January 1968 on Columbia Records. The album itself is a very good album although in some ways, this feels like the most dated or ""reserved"" of their work. The back and forth between the guys isn't quite as free flowing as it would be on later albums or so it seems to me. That's not to say that this is a bad album, quite the contrary as most of it is downright inspired and even groundbreaking in many ways. Temporarily Humboldt County is a stinging bit about the treatment of Native Americans, Le Trente-Huit Cunegonde is a priceless take on what it would be like if Hippies ran the world and the second half is not to be missed."
2,Absolutely perfect,"There is not one single bad thing I can say about this film. None. It is my 3rd most favorite film of all time. The acting is some of the finest out there, the costumes, plot, drama, wit; superb. I gush about this film to everyone I know. When I am in a foul mood, all I need to do is put this in my dvd player and I am perfectly fine 2 hours later. Anyone who is and isn't a Jane Austen fan should watch it. If you love period films, then this is the movie for you. Like I said, I could never critique it properly because I could never find the right words to describe it.Though people would consider it a 'chick flick', I have seen this with my fiance and he actually liked it as well. I cant stress enough how wonderful all the actors are. Kate Winslet, who is probably my favorite British acress is spectacular in this, Emma Thompson and of course the ridiculously perfect Alan Rickman all make this film worthwhile to watch."
2,My all-time favorite movie!!!,"Though I was never a Jane Austen fan in high school, this movie has made me a fan. I have gone back and re-read every one of her books and now finally understand why they are classics. This movie has everything. It's romantic, funny, heartwrenching and heartwarming. From the scene where Elinor sits on the stairs drinking tea while her sisters and mother cry in their bedrooms to the scene where Edward at long last, confesses his love for Elinor, this movie is perfect. I highly recommend it! :-)"
2,Absolutely wonderful!,"Without a doubt, the best movie adaptation of a Jane Austen novel I have ever seen! I was enraptured by the perfect choice of characters, the breathtaking acting and dramatic scenes, the music (I couldn't rest until I had bought the songs Marianne plays on the piano so that I could play them for myself!) and even the poetry!All hopeless romantics will fall in love with this film; I watched it twelve times the first week I saw it. Having read the book, I would say that this movie represents one of the few instances where a screenplay outdoes its book.All the characters have been wonderfully cast, especially Alan Rickman as Colonel Brandon, Kate Winslet as Marianne, and Elizabeth Spriggs as Mrs. Jennings. (My personal favorite!)Be prepared to love this movie!!"
2,Ron Review,The item was received on time and as described. It was packed for shipment in a careful and protective manner. I recommend this vendor.
2,Magic Islands: A Treasure-Trove of San Juan Islands Lore,This was a gift for a relative who recently moved to the San Juan Islands. She loved what she was able to discover about her new home!
2,Great for entry level bioethics class,This is well written and concise...I choose it for the Bioethics class I will be teaching in Jan 07.Author knows what he is talking about!
2,Paul Shepard was one of the most brilliant minds we had!,"Paul Shepard (who also wrote The Tender Carnivore, which is also highly recommended)was one of the most insightful and brilliant thinkers of our century. This book has the power and impact of Thom Hartmann's ""The Last Hours of Ancient Sunlight"" and the insights of Michael Tobias's ""World War III."" Highly recommended."
2,Old Leapster Best,"I have both the old and new version of the leapster. My younger daughter no longer uses her new leapster because it was difficult to hear. So we purchased her an old leapster that we found at a store. The new leapster is cute, I must say, but the sound is much lower than in the old version. I spoke with a Leapfrog representative (fabulous custormer service) and after testing it while I waited, he confirmed that the sound decibal was significantly lower. However, since it met their standards it was not technically a defect. They informed me that the old version has not been in production for quite a while and no plans were in place to bring it back. Any old version you find for sale is all that is left."
2,"Great educational, but really fun toy!","We already bought one of these for my daughters 6th birthday back in August. She looved it! Atthis time, my soon to be 5 year old daughter said that is what I want exactly. It is durable, educational, and fun. They both love sharing the games. Great for 'alone time' as well!"
2,Leapster,My 5 year old is enjoying her Leapster. It has definitely kept her busy and quiet! It has been dropped a few time and is working great.
2,Wonderful,I bought this for my 4 1/2 yr old granddaughter and it has been the best toy I have ever purchased. She has no problem playing any of the games and will just sit for hours playing it. I love that it has a volume control because some of the games are louder than others. It is very durable and has withstood a few droppings here and there. The only thing I would change on it would be to make the screen a little bigger.This is a excellent toy and I would recommend it to anyone.
2,Disgusted w/ this Company!,"You pay this much money for a video game system and it doesn't come with the cord to plug the thing into the wall! HOW STUPID, when you buy a battery radio or tv they still give you the cord... why does this company consider this ""an accessory"", SO THEY CAN BLEED PARENTS FOR MORE MONEY! It would seem to me that accessories are the carrying case, the headphones, things of that sort.Very upsetting.The game system is a good one but I'm sick and tired of being taken advantage of!"
2,Grandmothers gift to a princess,"I purchased this as a gift for my granddaughter for Christmas. She loves it. She now has two leapsters and uses them to their greatest potential. The game cartridges are easy to install, the graphics very good and sound is controllable. Wonderful product for children to learn and have fun with..."
2,Worth the money,I bought this for my 7 years old daughter who loves it. She loves the Math Missions learning game. We also purchased I Spy and we look forward to getting the 2nd Grade game as well. We like the fact that she is getting a lot out of it. I would much rather have her play Leapster than a Gameboy. I think It has more to offer.
2,The whole family loves it!,"We purchased this for our 5 yr old daughter, along with a few games. We all love it. My 2 yr old enjoys the drawing and coloring option and our 7 yr old son wants one as well. We're very pleased with this purchase."
2,Great Except for the small screen,"I'm about to purchase a second leapster for my 3 year old daughter, as she's getting tired of sharing her 5 year old brother's leapster. I'm a bit disappointed that the screen size in this model is smaller than the older model. It's hard enough with the bigger screen for the kids to use the touch screen.The leapster my son has is now about two years old and has taken quite a bit of abuse, and it's still working perfectly. The games for this system are great and I can really tell that my kids are learning something.Personally, I think the recharging system is a waste. Why have a recharger that can only be used on the leapster? I picked up a generic battery charger and some rechargeable AA batteries."
2,My daughter loves this!,We got this a few years ago for my daughter. She's 9 now and still plays with it. It's very durable and is a great learning toy.
2,Great tool for learning!,"I purchased this for my three year old, since she has a friend at daycare with one- she wanted her own.I also bought the Wall-E game and Disney Princess game for her to use, and her brother begs for turns on Wall-E. My son has his own Leapster with the Cars game-that one they both share as well. The Jedi math is a little scary for them, so we'll save that one for later.We also like the preloaded games, since Coloring Corral is so easy to play, and Rabbit River reminds me of Frogger.Easy to get the games set-up, but a little hard for not so dextrous three year old hands using a stylus to type in names, etc. Overall well worth the money!"
2,Great for child with ADHD,"My husband and I got the Leapster for our 7 year old daughter and are very happy with it. She is a child who typically can't focus on any single toy for more than 2 or 3 minutes at a time. She has ADHD and normally jumps from one toy to the next. We have tried all types of toys...dolls, dress-up items, board games etc... Nothing has gotten her attention for long until now. For some reason this toy has grabbed her attention and gotten her to focus. She is understanding educational concepts that have been very hard for her to understand in school. These are the same skills that have left her in tears in the past. I am VERY impressed! This is a GREAT learning tool for our daughter and we highly reccomend it. The Leapster is well worth the money!"
2,Leapfrog Leapster,My three year old was thrilled with this present when she received it at Christmas. She caught on how to use it very quickly and really enjoyed the coloring game that comes already in the Leapster. Unfortunately the pen quit working after a week. I emailed Leap Frog customer service and got no response. I suggest calling them for assistance instead. They sent a replacement pen but it took about two weeks. Very frustrating for me and my three year old. I was also surprised to find out that these pens cannot be purchased at stores- you must get them from Leap Frog.
2,Great Product,"We purchased the leapster for my son who is a very active child and hates to sit down to ""learn"". He is a little behind in school and we wanted to get something to help him learn but have fun at the same time. He gets bored easily so we were hesitant to make any purchase that would require more than 30 minutes of his time. However this was a huge hit! He enjoys racing and often selects the more advanced levels. We ended up buying a second leapster for my daughter. This has made our 40 minute commutes much easier!My only complaint would be that it doesn't have more games in the unit itself. I also would like to see more games on a preschool or pre-K level."
2,It was a wonderful book!!!!!!!!!!!,"My name is Sarah Madjlesi and I am a Senior in High School in Corinth, MS. I love Mary Englebreit and I love this book. I love all of her work and I love collecting her stuff."
2,Not holding up after three months,"My daughter got this for Christmas and loves the toy. She likes the games and is able to play them without trouble. It's also great to have something like this geared towards her younger age that she can use in the car when her older siblings are playing with their game-boys or listening to music.However, the toy has been working improperly for more than a month now. We have tried new batteries but find it continues to have a lot of the problems associated with low batteries such as delayed response, improper movement (she tries to get the character to go left and they go down or similar problems.) It's very frustrating for her."
2,Civ games are always fun,"I have enjoyed Sid's games for years. This expansion has had mixed reviews as the beyond the sword expansion is rated higher. Over all i picked up this title to round out the Civ 4 series. It adds wrinkles to the game that if you don't pick up beyond the sword, will add bosses and other features that will improve the basic game."
2,Wrong Title,"Not a bad collection of original hits, but putting Boston next to Loverboy is a bit too much. The non ""one-hit wonders"" have collections that are superior to this, but on the other hand, most music lovers would probably prefer to buy this CD instead of shelling out lots of money for an Arcadia or Starship compilation.

2,Amazing show but sound could be better,"The show itself deserves five stars, it's truly incredible. The ecstatic audience are the kind of crowd performers dream of.The sound quality is not as good as it should be. It lacks the clarity and fullness of the Live In NYC DVD. For this reason, I'm only giving this DVD four stars.Crank it and sing your heart out."
2,Paying the cost to still be the boss,The sound is great the video is fantastic. Yeah Bruce is getting up their in age but man he still puts on a great show. He also sits at the piano for a few old tunes which he rarely does. I too wish someday Bruce would release some of the old 70's footage but for now track down the bootlegs or enjoy this great show.
2,Bruce Springsteen & the E street Band: live in Barcelona,"I recommend this dvd to anyone that is a Bruce Springsteen fan. If you have seen him in concert, you will know that everyone of his are different...especially since he has ton's hit's from past until now to pick from. Loved this dvd! As always, he shows his energy & give all to the fans performance."
2,I'd give it 10 - 20 - 30 stars,"What you have to do is turn it up really loud, I mean so loud that when you clear your throat you can't hear yourself. Then close your eyes and I'd swear you think Bruce and the Band is right in front of you playing there hearts out. Buy it. It's incredible."
2,Positives outweigh Negative,On the postive side -- the only place to get great live renditions of most of the songs from The Rising; excellent video work capturing an exurberant performance by both the band and the crowd; and a good collection of reliable standards.On the negative side -- a surprising poor audio track for most of the vocals; don't they have decent mics in Spain??Overall I'm very happy with this DVD and haven't come close to getting bored after 3 viewings.
2,Awesome Show Average Recording,"I purchased the DVD in mid December 2010. I have always respected the Boss, especially coming from Cleveland, a city that has embraced him second only to his east coast home. I embraced the Rising and consider it one of his greatest pieces of work. I saw this tour and was excited to buy this disc. The song selection and concert is Awesome, but the recording at times can be muffled and distorted. Thus the four star rating. Still worth purchasing..."
2,poor sound quality,"we recieved this dvd yesterday from the great people at amazon.with everything of bruces we always can`t wait to watch it,but we were really dissappointed with the sound quality.whoever produced this dvd has really let bruce and the e street band down.live in new york will still stay our favourite."
2,Super Service,"Ordered two DVD's - easy online ordering - and super fast shipping. This is the best place to buy ""anything."""
2,Easy to Understand Science Books,"As the title saids, this book is about answering real life conundrums. There is a lot of ""what if"" questions that are readily answer. A reader with some background in high school or college physics will enjoy this book. As a student getting a science PhD, I find this book very entertaining to read. It answers questions in understandable English.Certain things I think can be explained a little better, like why the atmosphere is thinner at higher altitude. Or the difference between static friction and rolling friction. But these are just nicky-picky little things.Overall, this book is a joy to read. If you are curious about how things in life work or scenarios that you take for granted(like why birds don't get electrocuted standing on wires), you should pick up this book. You'll undoubtebly learn a lot."
2,A pleasurable yet informative glimpse into the world of science,"As would be expected from the title of the book, What Einstein Told His Barber will not saddle you with technical speak and complex analysis one might expect from Einstein himself. This book is clearly presented for the layman thus making the premises accessible to all.The information is straightforward and depicted with a curious sense of wit making the book a very enjoyable read. The Q&A; format easily permits one to peruse the book in any sequence affording one the freedom to focus only on particular areas of interest.If you enjoy science and are seeking a better understanding of universal concepts and the principals behind them, this book is worthwhile and one I recommend."
2,air force,what a great way to see the world; this book has helped lauch the careers of many of today's airmen. fly high.
2,Helpful,Im reading this before I go to AF Basic and I feel really prepared above and beyond. Some things I won't need to know until after but its still great to know anyway.
2,Night and day over a regular mach shaver.,Huge improvement over a regular mach shaver. I use the regular mach blades instead of the newer more expensive ones and get a close comfortable shave every time. The older blades seem to last longer and the battery never seems to run out on this.Update-August 2009 - 3 STARS for the handle. 5 STARS for the BLADES. I still really like the shave I get with these blades and the power handle. My problem is the quality of the handle has gone way down. My first one lasted forever. I left it at a hotel and figured I'd just buy a new one. The two replacements I've gotten both stopped vibrating within months. The first just stopped. The second seemed to have some leakage. I'll try one more since I don't want to get sucked into the fusion hype and expense.
2,Gillette M3 Nitro Power Razor,"For some reason I can no longer get this razor in the stores so I was very happy to find it on line. I have used one for the past 10 or more years. I shave in the shower and have a heavy beard. The combination of shaving in the shower plus the vibrating makes my shave less likely to cut and does a better job for me. I use a new blade this way every week where I used to need a new blade every day not to cut myself. I highly recommend it but don't understand why it is no longer sold. My guess is that people with normal beards don't care as much, but for me with a heavy beard this really helps. Glad I could find them being sold on line through Amazon."
2,Amazing quality for a 1924 film,"This is a charming movie and in such amazing quality for a motion picture filmed in 1924. It shows how rustic Laguna Beach was back then in contrast to it being presently another over-developed Orange County,CA community. Baby Peggy is a real little heart-stealer. This film is probably her best effort and shows why she was so wildly popular at the time. A timeless classic of a film just like the children's book which inspired it."
2,Exelent Replacement Bowl,I Love My Braun Chopper. 5 Years Later Original Bowl Had Cracks In It. This Replacement Bowl Is Identical To The Original And I Am Very Happy With It.
2,Great cups,I like these because they are simple and easy to wash. There are no valves. Washing valves and caps for most cups(Playtex) has always been hard and I was never sure if they were clean enough. I just bought 4 more of these this past weekend. The cups have been upgraded with caps and the spouts have been improve as well. I would recommend these to everyone.
2,Recommend for younger babies as first sippy cup,"These cups are great to introduce the sippy early and get rid of bottles. We used them from 9months till about 13months and then transitioned to cups and the harder, valve sippy cups. They are soft and easy to introduce and your baby does not need a long of hand dexterity to use. However, they do not last very long (although they are SUPER cheap) and babies eventually learn how to make them leak all over. Once my daughter learned to turn it upside down and mash it to get fluid to come out, I knew that it was time to transition to a cup and the hard top sippies. Once they have that dexterity, there is no need to keep them using these."
2,One of Hemingway's Best,"Well, had to read this one for a summer reading project... It's summer? Why do I have to do I still have homework??!!?? Oh well, anyways, The Old Man and the Sea was definitely a good choice. It is well written with much detail and a fine sense of imagery. It was worth losing part of the summer over"
2,Christmas at Rao's,"If you are an Italian American you will love this CD. It has all the old songs on it and I was particularily interested in Dominick the Donkey"" as I used to sing it to my son when he was little. Very nice gift..just fun to listen to."
2,great gift,"I bought this for a gift. The person could not stop talking about the cook book to this restaurant, which I bought for myself. Great history here and a great Christmas gift."
2,Christmas at its Best!,Christmas at Rao's is one of the best collections of Holiday Music for the entire family.
2,In Your Face Musical Comedy,"Kiss Me Kate is a wonderful presentation. Produced in 1953 it contains faux 3D affects -- with objects thrown at the camera (it probably was originally shown in 3D) occasionally. That's a little distracting, but it is a period piece.The show stopper Brush Up Your Shakespeare with Keenan Wynn and James Whitmore is excellent. Although neither is a singer or a dancer, they are charming.The comedy by-play of Kathryn Grayson and Howard Keel as the feuding divorced couple starring in a play within a play is wonderful. The staging of their two dressing rooms along with the choreography as they waltz through the rooms and hallway is fun to watch.The dancing is top rate with Ann Miller and Bobby Van, but my favorite person to watch is the very young Bob Fosse. Even in the early fifties you can see the dance moves that made him famous for the next four decades.This is a movie I'll watch again and again. I'll purchase the DVD when it becomes available, too."
2,Kiss Me Kate 1953,"When two squabbling ex-marrieds are cast as squabbling Renanaissance romantics in a musical ""The Taming Of the Sherew 1952"" , life imitates art , art imitates life -and it all proves no musical comedy imitates KISS ME KATE , the backstage / onstage delight from the 1948 Broadway smash and featuring 14 peerles Cole Porter (1891-1964) songs . Howard Keel (1919-2004) and Kathryn Grayson (1922- ) are the tangeled twosome So in Love despite her i hate men flashpoints . Ann Miller (1923-2003) adds heat , razzle-tap-dazzling .Zesty Choreography by Bob Foss (1927-1987) and Hermes Pan (1909-1990)Under George Sidney (1916-2002) nible direction . So brush up your Shakespeare and Enjoy . Kaste wont just Kiss you . Shell floor you !. DVD includes vintage documentary shorts : Mighty Manhattan and New Yorks Wonder city , the pure digital transfer in high resolution and enjoy both movies . Highly recommended"
2,Perfect sippy cup,"These do not leak, I can shake formula and not make a mess. They are easy for my 6mo old to hold and the silicone nipple is familiar to her and she takes these fine whereas the hard plastic sippy cups she pushes away.I have found these for $[...] each and for that price I dont worry about them getting lost or ruined or left at grandmas like I did with the Dr Browns bottles.Only problem is the 10oz and 14oz cups cant use eachothers screw-on caps, and so somtimes I have to check to see which one it is. Because it will tighten and if you click it too far it will open and my 6mo old can open it and spill the entire contents. But if the right cap is used there is no problem."
2,EXCELLENT,This is one of the best musicals! I love Howard Keel's voice and persona. It is a fun look at Shakespeare!
2,Basic Board to Draw & Learn On.,"My daughter who is 2 probably uses this board at least 4 days a week for a 1/2 to 1 hr. So, to me it is worth it. She tends to do her coloring on the play table we have, but she likes to use the paint brushed on the easel. We also draw shapes on the chalk board side. Has good space for holding crayons, chalk, etc. Very Sturdy. a 4 out of 5. We don't have any major problem with the paper not being held on the one side like other reviews mention."
2,Best Easel for young kids...,"This product is fantastic, really enables your kid to play with both the magnetic and chalk sides. Enables they to show a lot of their artistic qualities - highly recommended and good value."
2,$39.99 at Toys R US!,I noticed the reviews and no one mentioned that this exact easel is at Toys R Us for $39.99. How in the world am I the only one that noticed that! What a rip off! : /
2,Great transition cup!,"My son was not interested in ANY sippy cup for any reason ever. I got this cup (the one I got is actually an older model w/the mouthpiece in the middle instead of on the edge of the top) and my son took to it pretty much immediately! He likes the fact that the top feels like a nipple. He had no trouble figuring out that he should bite it to get the liquid out. I've only had it a day, but it doesn't appear to leak easily!"
2,Best Sippy Cup for Transitioning from a Bottle,"My son was very resistant to switching from the bottle to a sippy cup. His daycare recommended this cup and my son easily adjusted to using it instead of his bottle. (I also recommended it to a friend whose son was also having a difficult time and she also found that her son was able to adjust easily to the Nuby cup.) It is true that the silicone spout tears with use, but sippy cups are just another transitional step to an actual cup. Ours lasted until my son was ready for that step. Also, it is possible to buy replacement spouts online and we are doing that for our second son who will soon start to switch from the bottle to a cup."
2,Great for transitioning from bottle to cup.,"When I was trying to get my daughter off the bottle, she flat out refused all sippies. I gave this one a shot at the suggestion of a friend, and it was the winner. She took her milk from it with no problem at all. A few weeks later, I transitioned her from this cup to a hard-spouted sippy and never looked back.I wouldn't, however, recommend this cup for everyday or long-term use. The cup does leak, no question about it. And the spout does tear open if abused (and actually, my daughter never chewed on it and it STILL tore!) But if you need a cup to help get your child off the bottle, do give this one a try!"
2,It's a pretty easel.,"We've only had it for one day and it has withstood my 2-year-old climbing around and underneath it (because he thinks everything is a piece of playground equipment). The reason for this review is to let people know that in order to make the art trays stay on the easel (several people have complained that they easily fall off), you have to reach behind (inside) the easel and snap them on. You don't just sit them on; they snap in place. Do this and they won't keep falling off. : )"
2,"Great Player, plays 46 hrs with 1 AA battery!","Sound is astonishing.Plays 46 hours on 1 AA battery.Easy use. Plug in pc and draw files to player.Line IN encoding: possible to use with other devices (DVD/hi fi etc).voice recording.Much better than the 20 Gb HDD Samsung MP3 player that could only play 9 hours max, after 3 hours loading.Highly reccommadable."
2,Excellent mp3 player ! But upgrade the firmware ...,"I had a need for a small AA-driven mp3 player, and this one certainly fit the bill ! I had trouble loading it to full capacity until I upgraded the firmware. I installed v3.180 and have since had zero problems. I am completely happy with this player. It is extremely easy to use and has great sound."
2,Nice,"Great size, battery life, features, sound. Easy to load right through USB port. I use the built in mic to record classes and the quality is pretty decent but not as good as my friend's Olympus voice recorder. The unit turns on easily with a push of a button and this has happened a few times inadvertently while in my pocket - this is the reason I held back one star."
2,Graphic SF Reader,"Once I saw that there was a Velantian in this, from E. E. Doc Smith's Lensman series, I was sold, and had to get it. Done as a page by page look at each species the artwork is excellent, and these are the sort of funny looking monster types that kids like too, so it can work on more than one level, most definitely."
2,Gives new meaning to loving a book to death,"_Wayne Barlowe's Guide to Extraterrestrials_ is my 12 year old son/fantasy/scfi fanatic's favorite book. It is dog-eared from so much love, reading, studying and attention. This is no kid's book, though--these are the wunderkind's Wayne Barlowe's illustrations that have appeared in many famous scfi books. Each alien has a full bio-ethnographic description, bring each to life."
2,Awesome Artwork,"Barlowe's Guide to Extraterrestrials is a really good book if you need to jumpstart your imagination. It has drawings of the different species, as well as back ground information like habitat, reproduction, things like that. I would recommend this book to anyone who loves fantasy artwork, fantasy/science fiction in general, and also who has a crazy imagination already!"
2,Barlowe's Guide to Extraterrestrials,"This is a wonderful book with detailed pictures and descriptions of aliens light and dark,good and evil, cruel and kind, and large and small. It has vibrant illustrations that grab the eye, and descriptions that send the mind and imagination to worlds millions of light years away. You will not find these alien faces anywhere else but in this book. I would recommend it to any science fiction lover who can get their hands on it."
2,EXCELLENT!,"Being gluten free you shouldn't expect items made from rice flour to taste the same as those made from wheat flour. That being said, these pizza shells are excellent. It's so great to be able to eat pizza again. I've been eating a pizza every day since I received them. This is my first exposure to Ener-G foods and I am very impressed. After amazon warehouse deals sent me some moldy and fermented shells, the staff at Ener-G sent me a replacement at no cost. They were overwhelmingly friendly and professional. Highly Recommend!!! Just don't expect it to taste like pizza made from wheat."
2,Simply the best tree guide available for starters or experts,"This guide uses a simple key to identify most common (and a few uncommon)trees in the Eastern US and Canada. At the end of the search are some of the most interesting facts and details I've found. At this price, this book should be in everybody's hip pocket every time you enter the woods!"
2,"think of it as ""Alien Centerfolds of Sci-Fi""","The artwork in this book is fabulous. It's a neat little companion book for sci-fi fans; it has wonderful illustrations of all the various organisms that have been portrayed in some of sci-fi's classic and canonical works. And along with those illustrations? Little one-page write ups on their biology, social structure, etc."
2,Wish it had a couple more things! all & all not to bad,"There are a couple thing I wish I new before I bought this book one of the things I wish I new before getting this book is I wish this was in Color meaning the Pictures in the Book of all the different trees & branches including the bark est. I also wish it came with more Pictures of not only different trees but maybe picture of what some seedlings of some of the trees looked like. Also wish it would have showed what the ""seedling"" of every tree that was in the book i also wish it would tell you what the difference between a male and female tree is. I know this is a book only about trees about Eastern and central US & Canada but still. But I still like book. Later I will video tape the inside of the book scrawl threw it a little give people more of run down of the Book."
2,"A gripping, touching novel...I couldn't put it down.","Melnyk has done an outstanding job of making you feel like you're there. The characters are exceptionally well developed and the interesting settings of Montreal, combined with the tragedies of war-time Germany and the Holocaust combine to make this a must read. An excellent book that would make a spectacular movie."
2,Live Fire!,"It's a great thing to see all the early Marshall Tucker Band albums being remastered and rereleased. Apparently, this CD is an unreleased live album with a few added tracks. The main album was recorded on two nights in England in late 1976. The added tracks are the ten-minute-plus ""The Thrill Is Gone"" from the 1975 Volunteer Jam (featuring guests Dickey Betts, Chuck Leavell and Charlie Daniels), and ""Ramblin'"" and ""24 Hours At A Time"" from 1974 (and previously released on ""Where We All Belong""). Sound quality varies on the tracks, but most of the performances are amazing. You can hear why this band was such a hot live commodity. I wish the editing between tracks was better; that would give more of a semblance of a real live show. Still it's great, just having this stuff.........."
2,Nice release - should have been 2 CDs,Very nice release. Was lucky to see the original lineup a few times in the early 70s. My only gripe is there should be more than enough live material for a 2 CD release and why include the live cuts from Where We all Belong. Repetitive and disappointing when other material could have been selected.
2,Stompin' good music,"This collection is 11 songs from 1974-1976 and consists of live performances from Milwaukee, WI, Murfreesboro,TN, and London & Manchester, England. Outstanding collection with great extended instrumentals on all the songs. All Marshall Tucker Band fans will love this one."
2,SOUTHERN MAN,"Hey Kireviewer,get a life buddy .Enjoy the moment.This album is not perfect,but didn't the audience enjoy it.Southern rock at its best.This band is best when it plays live,no doubt about it.This band rocks.Crossy"
2,A book that touches all your senses.,From Me to My Children is an exceptional book that is well wirtten. It has many levels of understanding from the most simple to the most profound. The autor portrays the importance of one of the most delicate relationships in life... a parent to a child. Its' unique style is exactly that. Hues of Blues Publishing co. intertwines all five senses to make you fully aware of the author's message... as only they can! Truly a beautiful book in which every human can feed their soul with!Richard Chalme'
2,Just what I needed,This is a great book for the camper. Can't wait until Spring to get out there and use it. Service was great and fast.
2,Amazing,"It could be science fictionmyths...unrealistic scenario,but certainly it is amazing.So much work went in thepreparation of this book.So much details.My God!It is really amazing....S. Mahdi, Cairo, Egypt."
2,Good and not forgotten,This is the second time I've bought this book. I loved the first time I bought it and I loved it this time too.
2,This book is way cool!,"This was one of my favorite books when I was a kid just starting out to read Science Fiction. It's sort of like one of those ""real"" nature books with drawings, habitats, and biological information, but it's all about aliens from major Science Fiction authors. You figure the authors of this book have got to have a lot of information to put something like this together. For those of a puerile nature (or those who read a lot of Niven's rishartha), they even have some alien species' mating habits. In the middle there is a scale diagram of all of the aliens' sizes which was my first exposure to the wonderful world of the metric system. Buy it, read it, in will enrich your Science Fiction library"
2,Great MP3 player only one problem with it though,"The mp3 player has a setting on it called the wow eq, which makes the songs sound incredibly good, however the play/stop button on the top will get accidentally pushed alot if you put it in your pocket (to keep this from happening all you have to do is use the hold button, located on the exact opposite side of the mp3 player, if you put it hold it won't stop playing no matter what you do, until it is taken off hold) but that is one thing I've run into. So its basically its really durable, sounds great, but accidentally stops playing if you put it in pocket without putting it on hold."
2,Put it on your short list!,"I decided to buy a player as a 40th birthday present for myself. I thought about buying an iPod shuffle, but decided to check out customer and professional reviews first. PC World's review of the iPod said the Samsung product was a much better buy (since it includes 1) FM tuner, 2) an LCD display & 3) a voice recorder, and is made out of metal, not plastic), so I started looking at the reviews for the YP-MT6X. The reviews were stellar, and I decided to ""roll the dice"" and order this on line (since no store in our shopping area carried the player). The gamble paid off - I got a great player and I highly recommend it for anyone looking for an alternative to iPod."
2,Alma goes on the Turbo Diet,"I read Alma goes on the Turbo Diet & The Turbo-Protien Diet. They were a very fast read and similar. Alma goes on the Turbo Diet was very simple in its approach while The Turbo-Protien Diet was more technical.I have tried many, many diets. I started this program last Sunday at 153pds. I am 5'7"". I feel most comfortable at 130pds. As of today, I am at 145.5 (7.5pds lighter). I have a lot of energy.HOWEVER, this is NOT a diet for anyone that has never drank protein shakes. Before the diet, I had 1 a day and a protein bar. The mixture from this diet tastes much worse than a regular protein shake. I am now very comfortable with the taste. The first day was the worse--determining amounts of powder to water.I am really happy and will be on it for 7 more days. I work out 30-40 minutes a day normally and still have the energy to do so.Good luck."
2,Childhood Treasure,"I have this album, it was purchased for me when I was twelve back in 1977. I listened to it on the weekends while my father prepared dinner. I really don't have a nice system to play it on anymore. I was hoping to find someone that copied it to cd."
2,Excellent,"I got it for a very good price and it does works great, only a few time i have feel some noise and low volume when speaking, but that's probably the phone company."
2,Just what I needed,"After many years of using disposable foil pans, I decided I was finally ready for the real thing. The Circulon roaster came in time for Thanksgiving and a test with the fresh turkey I had ordered locally. Two things stand out. First, cleanup of the pan was a breeze, and of the rack just slightly less so. Second, the bird was done significantly sooner than I expected (and I usually have the opposite experience). I am convinced that the rack, which is raised well above the bottom of the pan, promotes the circulation of air and cooks the fowl much faster. My turkey was over 18 pounds and this roaster could easily accommodate a larger one.I can't wait for the next excuse to use it."
2,Best value !!!! Excellent roaster!!!!,"This is one of the best values I've seen in a long time. A quality Circulon roasting pan, perfect size for just about anything, lightweight and easy to clean!!!! Jump on this one, and if you can, buy one for someone else!!! It is top-notch!!!!"
2,cerculon roaster,"Iam very pleased with this roaster. It's so easy to clean, no scrubbing required. It is a great buy for anyone. Nancy"
2,Excellent roaster,"I purchased this roaster to use at Thanksgiving for my 24 pound turkey.I was very pleased with the quality of the roaster. It was well made, light weight and easy to clean.Also the price was very reasonable."
2,Perfect roasting pan,This is the perfect roasting pan! I am really pleased with its size and how easy to clean it was. I roasted a turkey and used the pan drippings for gravy and had no problems cleaning the pan afterwards. I highly recommend this one.
2,Global Warming,This was an interesting read--a little behind the times--but still applicable today. I rec'd an A on my report on this subject!!! Apparently I chose wisely!
2,The Ego that was GERTRUDE,"This book doesn't present any great revelations and certainly won't surprise those already familiar with the egomaniacal Ms. Stein but for anyone who has suffered the pains of sibling rifts this is any interesting read. Both brother and sister are tortured and pathetic in their own ways, Gertrude for having stubbornly believed she was a literary genius (a delusion I doubt fostered by very many today with the value of her literary contributions negligible) and Leo for having simply been a neurotic posterchild who couldn't go on with his life after their separation. This is a better book still because it does not focus on Gertrude's non-existent literary legacy but instead chooses to reveal two lives both richly interesting and complex and yet with a bitter vulnerability."
2,And then there was silence,"This song is just the best. There is simply nothing else like it. Yes, it lasts for over 16 minutes, throughout it, it retells the story of the Illiad and fall of Troy. It recounts many of the main themes within it (including my favourite part where it says ""Shes like the sunrise, precious like starlight,"" etc... describing Helen). If you enjoyed previous albums by blind guardian then this is a MUST. It manages to convey in the sheer sounds of the music going from softness to heavy drums and guitar solos, showing the moods in the story of sadness and triumph. The meaningful lyrics are a prime example of blind guardian's finest and Hansi's singing is again almost flawless. Just buy it! (the second track harvest of sorrow is also good, but doesn't match up to the main feature.) Also buy their new album A Night At the Opera (instead or as well?), the Jap import has harvest of sorrow as a bonus track, and the last song is and then there was silence."
2,Odd Single to show the fans that they got the goods!!,"Many Will be surprised by how long the main track is. 14 whole minutes! No lie! Now let me review the 2 songs:1. And There Was Silence - A desent song that is way too long. A epic all the way! You have to give it some listens to start enjoying it. . . . .85% 2. Harvest Of Sorrow - A short 3 minute song that is oh so soft. They truely shine here. Buy this single for this track! . . .95%3. Multimedia Track (Video of ""Born in a Mourning Hall"") - This track is easy to download onto most pc's (My 1995 computer did it so your's should!) The video is decent. . ./ .85% If you like this album: Well you should get Blind Guardian's new album out by March (2002). Also:Blind Guardian-Nightfall in Middle Earth, Blind Guardian-Imaginations from the other Side, Blind Guardian-Somewhere far Beyond, Blind Guardian-Forgotten tales, Falconer-Falconer, and Demons and Wizards-Demons and Wizards."
2,Beautiful.,"Blind Guardian gets better and better. Every new release is orders of magnitude superior to everything that has come before. This single is no exception. A long (14 min.) song with epic poetry (The Iliad) as subject matter? What a wonderful idea. The musicianship is more than notable. The b-side, Harvest of Sorrow, is also a good tune that shows BG not only can Write Epic Orchestral pieces, but also softer, more acoustic, more mellow ballads."
2,HEMINGWAY'S BEST WORK,It was a sensational book and it gets better and better every time you read it
2,wicked good book,"This was an awesome book. The descriptions are fantastic, you are there helping him catch the fish.(the actual book, that is)iT is a short and enjoyable read. Definately worth the time-you will be amazed at human willpower and strength."
2,Knowledge is Power,"This is an amazing book. Many people will be intimidated by it. If you aren't open minded, don't read it. This book is a threat to many people's previous beliefs -- or the brainwash and propaganda from different sources. Expect to be illuminated."
2,Redefining Chick,Barbara definitely has her slant but she does allow historical truths and a collective voice to resonate with the reader. This book has strengthened a sense of detachment from the dominant historical rhetoric of today for me-- while offering a sound perspective to add to my own. A must-read for anyone interested in the marginalized yet tremendously relevant experiences of people globally.
2,Excellent in every sense,"Excellent musicians and excellent live performances. In short, this DVD is fantastic."
2,Keepin' it real....,"Being a musician and having seen Dixie Chicks live on this tour, I can tell you that both live and on the DVD the singing and playing from all three is live.For people who feel the singing is not live, perhaps they are struggling with the fact that, yes, there are attractive women who are this good in terms of musicianship and can think for themselves. While I can see why some would find the video editing distracting, it has grown on me after a couple of viewings.My only complaints are that Truth No. 2 should have been included since it is a galvanizing moment in the concert, and that the labeling of the DVD could be a bit more up front so that people expecting a single live performance would not be disappointed."
2,Love the Chicks. Hate the editing.,"I find the frenetic costume change with every shot editing of the DVD very distracting and would have preferred a single performance at a single venue, or at least each song whole from a single performance/venue rather than the contrived, abeit expert, mixing of shots from many performances during the course of each song. The Dixie Chicks do not need this kind of technical trickery to entertain me and I much prefer their first DVD for the purity of performance. If they chose to release a second version of this DVD without the frenetic editing, I'd buy it in a heartbeat."
2,Different!,"First of all, for those that have said the sound on this DVD is too perfect (inplying that it's been `touched up' in the studio), let me just say that I've had the pleasure of seeing the Dixie Chicks live, & they do indeed sound this good!The Chicks are great live performers - energetic, enthusiastic & entertaining, & you see it all here!The reason I've given this DVD 4 stars instead of 5 is that it's suffering from severe schizophrenia - it's actually filmed at about 10 different concerts, but you don't see a whole song from 1 concert. Instead it will be a few seconds from one, & then on to another. The first time I watched it I found it quite bizarre! However the editing is seamless, & it's fun seeing all their different outfits.I've now watched it a few times, & it's really grown on me!!No extra's to speak of, but then in music DVD's they rarely seem to bother with them any more."
2,GET OVER IT !,"To anyone, and everyone that has a problem with free speech in the USA needs to get over it. Let's enjoy the music and be thankful that, (those living in the USA and elsewhere where this would apply), we have the ability and the FREEDOM to speak our minds without fear of DEATH.ROCK ON DIXIE CHICKS !!!"
2,It's ALMOST as good as being there. . .,"I, unlike some of the other reviewers, was unable to see the Chicks in concert, so I have nothing to base my review off of other than the DVD. I'm sure seeing them live in person would be amazing, but I thought this DVD was great!It captures their personalities, their spirit and the music wonderfully in my opionion.I was a little confused in the first couple of minutes (as one reviewer pointed out, they edited the video from as many as 10 different shows- so there is some definite costume and hair changes). But, after the first song, it's easy to get used to, and kind of cool.Don't be nervous because of all of the negative reviews. I got this as a Christmas gift, and I absolutely love it.It also has a bonus music video of ""Top of the World."""
2,Fights off everything! Many uses other than cold sores!,"While I don't get cold sores, I am extremely prone to getting impetigo/ staph infections. The doctor always puts me on antiobiotics(which don't help)and steroids (which do help but are not a long term solution). With this lip balm, I have been able to avoid any infections. Even tea tree lip balms have not worked for me. I love this product and was glad I have it a try. Highly recommended!"
2,Top of the Line (mostly),"Great concert video all-around, but I would have preferred to see one complete concert without all the editing of footage from several. It's also refreshing to see the band focusing on the music, and barely even addressing the controversy that has seemingly engulfed them this past year.The ""Top of the World"" video included here is a nice bonus, a surprisingly effective cautionary tale that you may to watch more than once to fully grasp.Certainly this is a must-have for fans. And at the price, it's the best 10 bucks you're likely to spend all year."
2,Works Well / Slightly Annoying,"The case works well enough. I like the top bars that hold the sleeves in place when the case is closed. Also, there are two rows of sleeves -- each row has an extra sleeve in front with an index card (it lists the numbers for each sleeve and has a line to write the name of the disc at that index). The only annoying thing about this case is the sleeves -- their openings to put the disc into have a plastic cover that must be taken off in order to insert the disc. However, once they are off, it never has to be done again, so it is an annoyance that only has to be dealt with once, which isn't too bad. Still, had the sleeves come ready to accept discs, it would save quite a few minutes of time. If wasting a little time doesn't matter to you, I highly recommend this case."
2,Funny.,"Very funny, clean humor. Not as good as the first three though. And the dvd came in a paper sleeve instead of a dvd case."
2,Five Star for the Genre,"This is the best of the ""thou Shalt Laugh"" series.All of the other videos I rented first to see if worth buying.NOPE, they were not in our opinion as a familyThey were hit or miss on the funny..usually 2 to 1 on misses.This however is consistent in the humourClean cut , Christian funSome potential Bill Cosbys in the group..seeing the absurd in everdyay thingsThis is one you can buy and will watch more than once..maybe invite others over for a comedyevening w/ popcorn !This is a very hard genre to be funny inMost comedians have to sink to swearing, sex jokes or toilet type humourIt takes a lot of talent to stay clean and funnyIf you want clean cut family fun....this is it !!!"
2,For completely clean humor it is really funny,"I was surprised at how funny these comedians were. I was also very pleased with the variety of acts there were. The first comedian was funny in his own right (used a lot of one liners) but also used a lot of facial expressions and hand gestures in addition to his humor. The next comedian was VERY dry but at the same time funny. He was a little slow at first, but once he got going it was funny. The next guy was more of a prop comedian and did a great job with it.I definitely recommend this DVD. I greatly enjoyed watching. With that said, these are not shows you would consider headliner comedians. However, they are quite enjoyable."
2,Funny Clean Humor,I gave this as a gift to a friend who has shared it with all his other friends. It has very little objectionable materials. It has great laughs. I am looking forward to viewing it again and will probably by the earlier editions as well.
2,We Laughed. I was pleasantly surprised,"There is an obvious emphasis on being unoffensive, even ""Christian"" (culturally Christian, like the I have a Christian dog, Christian cat, and Christian lawn, nothing to do with doctrine kind of Christian) in these routines. I have to admit, I am immediately skeptical of any of these Christian-trying-to-emulate-something-the-world-does kinds of products. Nevertheless, my wife and I definitely laughed and thoroughly enjoyed most of this dvd.The magician was poor, but the rest of the routines were funny, some (Joe Wong in particular) were even incredibly memorable. I could definitely see us watching this again in the future. That in and of itself was a pleasant surprise."
2,Beautiful Light,We needed to replace our twenty year old front porch light. This light worked perfectly and was easy to install. Plus it looks beautiful and works!
2,"Great Ideas, Easy Recipes","I'm no gourmet cook, so this cookbook was right up my alley! The chocolate pie was to die for! It has lots of great and easy to prepare recipes. I recommend it to the beginners and anyone who is having trouble sticking with the Low Carb dieting."
2,Jump start your journey to health and fitness,"By most reasonable standards Senior Fitness is an exceptional book on health and fitness. Its basic message is simple and intellectually sound. The recommendations are based on both solid science (multiple studies with convergent findings) and the results of the author's own heroic battle against cancer. On a personal level I found the book quite inspiring, providing just the impetus I needed to adjust my personal diet and exercise regimen. Dr. Heidrich doesn't equivocate or offer us simplistic solutions that require no work on our part, but the reward of good health and a vigorous old age should more than justify our efforts. The message is clear, the science is sound and if you're looking for a good book to jump start your own personal fitness program this is a great place to start."
2,Reprint of Silhouette,"Readers who love Linda Howard will enjoy this title. However, kepp in mind that it is a reprint from her Silhouette days."
2,an inspiring tale of a outcast,"this book can bring you to tears. the story of an outcast grandson of man o' war who becomes one the greatest racehorses in history is truly an amazing tale of life, love, trust, and friendship. a story of a fighting champion, with endless endurance and a heart as big as a horse blanket for those who loved and trusted him. seabiscuit was an amazing horse for whom which setting track records and stomping out competition was an old story. truly a breath-taking tale of courage."
2,excellent book,This is my favorite author. He presents the facts in an easy to read informative style . Positively a mood lifter.
2,"If your child loves horses, they will like this too.",I read this book many times as a child. It was about a lesser know racehorse who overcame much adversity to become one of the greatest thoroughbreds in racing history
2,A Great Introductory Functional Analysis Textbook!,"In deed, Kolmogorov and Fomin did it again to co-author a wonderful math book as their ""Introductory Real Analysis"" (by Dover). A major difference between American writers and Russian writers in math writing is that Russian authors are more reader concious. Consequently, their books are more reader-friendly. No show off in one's math level and no unnecessary skip of key steps to slow down the reader. Their books' price is also always reasonable. I recommend this book for senior math and engineering students interested in mastering the modern language of math."
2,"Great book, fair reprint","I must say that Kolmogorov is one of my favorite Russian scientists and scientific writers (the others are Arnol'd, Gel'fand and Landau). His approach over real and functional analysis is superb. But I have a serious complaint: why did Dover choose the old and dated Graylock edition to reprint this masterpiece? The most recent Russian edition has a lot of other important topics (missing in Dover's reprint), such as differential calculus in Banach spaces, which is so difficult to find a decent treatment of. The organization of the book is also better in the Russian edition. A good revised and translated reprint of it would deserve not five, but six, seven, ten stars..."
2,Better than his fabulous Real Analysis book,"This book is better than his fabulous Real Analysis book. It is one of the best, if not THE best, functional analysis book out there and the price is low. Quality to price ratio is approaching infinity here (as Dover reduces the price more)!!!Kolmogorov knows how to arrange topics and introduce them at the proper spots throughout the book. Everything is broken down into bite sized pieces and you are given enough examples to digest what's going on. Reading the book is like reading Kolmogorov's mind, as he has tried to teach HOW TO THINK about the material, not just DO IT. It's also very addictive, even though it's rigorous.Name a better functional analysis book? Not sure if that's possible."
2,a very hard to find cd,"this is a hard to find cd, but it is one of marshall tucker bands best ones this one takes me way back, but it's still great to listen too. I hunted for this a long time & couldn't get over it when I found it here"
2,The MTB's best studio release,"This is one of the best albums of the 70's, not just from The MTB. This is simply a choice recording, and you should probably get it if you get it. ;)"
2,A Great Book,I enjoyed reading this book very much...and it rings true with documentation to prove it. It was enjoyable to read..as I have been a fan of Jeanette and Nelson for years and own 7 of their movies.
2,An Affair to Remember.....Again and Again,"Without a doubt, this book is fascinating. Well written and worth several reads, my only disappointment was the sadness of their passions being coerced when each married another.We can only presume that MGM icons feared great financial losses at the box office if the two had married. Their magic on screen, maybe, was threatened if they'd validated their love in private matrimony.The book is tenderly poignant, a vicarious experience. Each died too young - in their 60s. We appreciate the drama of two talented beautiful people living a fantasy. Only in 1930/1940 Hollywood could it be so compelling....."
2,Rough around the edges,"I normally don't like books about pushy, overbearing men, but this one just pushed me in the right direction. I would have given this a 4.5 stars because I would have liked a little more suspense. But the sex was hot but not too graphic and I liked the stubborn heroine - stubborn, not stupid. I must like it, I've read it 3 times over the years!"
2,oldie but goodie,I really think readers should be told upfront that a book is a reissue with a new title. This book is a good one one of LindaHowards best.
2,Good Intense Romance,Just what I'd expect from Linda Howard. Lots of passion and possesiveness from the hero (which I love). If you like any of her earlier novels you will enjoy this one as well.
2,A skillfully written romance story!,"Heartbreaker"" is a skillfully written romance story. I enjoy stories of this nature - stories of heartache, secrets, and raw determination showing the inner strength of the female character - to survive or to handle life as it is thrown at them. Stories that know how to keep the male character in line!Love Ms. Howard's writing style, characters and storyline. A Romance Novel I found to be very appealing.John SavoyC.E.O. & Financial AdvisorSavoy International MotionPictures Co."
2,Nice feel good romance,Can't go wrong with this Howard novel. All the best elements of a feel good romance and a can't put down story.
2,I brought this as a gift for my Brother. He loves it. Say it's very funny.,I brought this as a gift for my Brother. He loves it. Say it's very funny.
2,Having the flu right now does not help watching this,Frightening! This will take care of the overpopulation of the worldWe always revert to the guy with biggest gun wins.
2,Good Clean Comedy,Funny and entertaining and in a good clean way. Kids can enjoy it as well. Not that they will get everything but teenagers can.
2,Not the best of the series -,"Thou Shalt Laugh 4was an entertaining program, but none in the series have equaled the first."
2,All Time Lover's Classic....,"Even though this album was originally released way, way back in the mid/late seventies, it still holds a warm place in my heart for 'romantic ballads'. The huge hit single, ""Sometimes When We Touch"" is one of the most heart wrenching, romantic songs of that era. The way that Mr. Hill sings it with such passion and raw emotion still brings goose-bumps to me every time I hear it. His simple, yet meaningful lyrics tell of the pain and anguish that he tries to convey so well that you cannot help but be touched by the tune.The rest of this album also marks well with regards to his songwriting ability. Simple, yet meaningful songs, each telling their own special story.I would recomend this LP to anyone who is, or ever has been, in love. You cannot go wrong here."
2,his,best CD ever. Mellow and romantic story telling at his best! This is a great CD by a fireplace and a glass of wine :-)
2,Great...Creative.,I saw these guys live at a local venue and immediatly bought this CD. Every song is intresting and unique. This EP is only 7 songs long but I find myself listening to them over and over. Worth the money. Support these guys.
2,Very good.,"Very good band, expecially for one thats just starting out and isnt widely known. Came across them on one of the Listmania lists, and sence amazon doesnt have any sound clips I was taking a risk, but turned out very good. Will be buying their new album when it is released."
2,Chilled-out Electronica,"Unlike the previous reviewer, I knew vaguely what I was getting when I bought this record. But I must say it was better than I expected.The production by someone named Dirty Bix is very chilled-out--in the realm of Thievery Corporation or Kruder and Dorfmeister, but with Aria's sweet female vocals on top to make it more poppy. I would call it Trip Hop if that weren't such a dirty word these days, maybe Icelandic Lounge Electronica would be better.I'd say if you like Sneaker Pimpps, Morcheeba, Bjork, Zero 7, Mono, or Thievery Corporation, you should definitely get this CD..BTW, how does Iceland, a country with something like 150,000 people keep producing such great musical talent.\?"
2,If you like trip-hop...wow!,"Fans of Hooverphonic, Sneaker Pimps, Mono, and their ilk will find a friend in this CD, a superbly put-together collection of smooth ethereal vocals and laid-back beats. Great sound, great voice, great production all around. DON'T confuse it with the cheesy synth-opera CDs listed under the same name."
2,One of my favorite shows on TV - video review briefly discusses show and shows the package,"Length:: 0:45 MinsI love this show. I think it is one of the best comedies on TV right now. With that said, it is NOT appropriate for kids. Too much cursing, too much drinking and way too many sexual references. But for adults it is great fun. You don't need to like football (I do but it is not my favorite sport) or play fantasy football (I don't and really don't know much about it except for what this show has taught me) to like this show. The writing is consistently funny and the actors are great - excellent characters that are well developed and quirky. It is also funny because there are guys in the group with kids and others without and that is always a funny interplay - especially between the single guys and the kids. Taco singing about how Ellie was ""made"" by her parents at her birthday party has got to be one of the funniest songs in a TV show. Great show, witty banter - overall a raucous good time!"
2,I have to respectfully disagree...,"... with those who don't ""get"" this recording. Yes, it is not like Big Loada but it is every bit as good.There are beautiful melodies and ""arrangements"" here that rival or top his best work. Did he put down the drill now and then, yes he did, what you guys think he should keep making ""Feed me Weird Things"" over and over and over?""Dedicated Loop"" and ""Tomorrow World"" are two of the best tracks Mr. Jenkinson has ever recorded, and I have ALL of his CDs.If you have not heard Squarepusher, this CD would be a great place to start. This is among his most ""accessible"" work. If you don't like this, you are not likely to become a fan. But, do be prepared to listen to the whole thing at least 4 times before you make a judgement!"
2,Great disc by Squarepusher,"After listening to a lot of his music, spanning from his first stuff to his newest, I like this one the best, right next to Big Loada. It's more straightforward than a lot of his stuff, but it got a great feel to it.Those reviews above about the fact that there is no lyrics is hilarious. Vocals don't always make better music. I prefer no vocs, hence this is a great disc, buy if you like Drum and Bass/Jazz, and otherwise unique and creative music.Bone thugs,... hehe."
2,Gloriously frustrating!!!,"Good resource for interesting tidbits. You'll have to wade past the 'feminazi' attitude but there is real treasure here. Hours of fun, but frustrating in that some of the material is poorly referenced, but it sure is thought provoking. This book will make you mad!"
2,A Must-Read For Everyone!,"This wonderful book has been a part of my ever-growing library of women's issues and studies books for over 2 years. I return to it again and again for the ""original"" meanings of words that today have been masculinized beyond imagining! It reveals what most women secretly have known about our patriarchal culture - how it distorts, demeans and belittles a woman's life and all the issues she deals with day in and day out. Every woman should have this book in their homes to read and share with their husbands, boyfriends, daughters and sons. And if you can afford it, buy a copy for your best friend, too! It will change their lives - literally, and for the better."
2,Full of interesting possibilities,"I wouldn't recommend this work as a reference for scholars, but perhaps as a reference for poets and other writers. While etymological 'connections' are often used to make sweeping claims that don't stand up to even light scrutiny, this sort of thing can be fun, if not inspiring, where not taken too seriously. I don't think the author's substantial effort was wasted at all."
2,Myth is Myth,"This book provides an island of sanity in a world ruled by current myths and fairy tales. If you are not christian and a scholar of the bible, you are often belittled for non-belief, forced to defend yourself by only using the words from their sacred texts. This book provides the neccessary background and linguistic roots to counter many a theological offense. What Barbara Walker reconstructs from 4000 years of obstructed truths is nothing short of amazing, even if it is not *100%* accurate, and has feminist leanings. Christian doctrines always favor patriarcal interests. So fear not this book! Read and open your mind. Many things will click. Worth every penny. I have bought this book twice at full price, and I would buy it again if need be. An essential reference."
2,Excellent book!,I find myself picking up this book and just opening it to any page and reading!Such in depth information and the research is amazing.marijomoore.com
2,Amazing,"I'm not much of a reviewer, but I must say this is one of the best albums ever made. Jazz/Bass/Techno."
2,Satisfied,"I received my purchase in a timely manner and was pleased with the quality. No confusion or problems. And On an even brighter note, excellent show!"
2,only 6 episodes so dont overpay,"great show, it is only 6 episodes long. so dont overpay for it. funny over the top jokes by a great set of actors"
2,original,"The show is just original and funny, and i enjoy every moment. i have seen all of the seasons and they are all great."
2,Good clean humor...,"Thou Shalt Laugh 4 contains good clean humor for the whole family to enjoy. The DVD was completely family-friendly. Many comedians appearing on prime time TV are just plain crass anymore, and not suitable for family viewing. No crassness is contained in Thou Shalt Laugh 4.The comedians on the disc had a broad range of humor styles, which further contributed to the entertainment value of the DVD. I especially liked the fact that the DVD was ""for Christians, by Christians"". Thou Shalt Laugh 4 made me laugh out loud quite a few times with jokes that were sometimes silly, sometimes serious and sometimes just plain fun."
2,Fasinating Forensic Facts For Forensic Fanatics,":) This easy reading book has many vivid pictures and facts. It was well researched and written. If your into Forensics and such, your NOT wasting your money/time on this one. The writer does not baffle you with fancy words he doesn't explain, or speak to the reader in a ""If you've got to look it up, you shouldn't be reading it"" tone. Worth your time!! Esp. if your just curious and don't want to get in too deep."
2,Kentucky Bluegrass Award Nominee - Excellent Choice,"This book is a 2003 nominee for the Kentucky Bluegrass Award for high school students. I would definitely choose this one for any student who had an interest in forensic science. Hidden Evidence is not just a fact-filled textbook-type of book. Owen explains the process behind many types of murder investigations, from arson to drowning to poison. The details are well explained and easy enough to understand even for those who are not familiar with forensic terminology. The book contains forty true crime cases and how forensics helped (or didn't help)solve them. It contains many graphic photos of actual crime scenes, but is definitely not for the squeamish. This is an excellent choice for anyone who enjoyes reading about true-crime and forensic science."
2,To each his own,"I have read all of the reviews and I guess everyone has a right to their opinion, so here is mine. This video is clear and concise in it's instruction. Joynan has a very open and easy to follow teaching technique. She obviously has a lot of experience. The three performances clearly show her individual style and technique and are an inspiration for beginners. I have six belly dancing videos in my collection so far and this one is by far the best. I'll buy anything else that she puts out in a second."
2,Good video,"I enjoy this video a great deal. It amazes me that Joynan's a grandmother and looks so great. She explains the moves clearly. Each teacher/video offers a slightly different approach, and her explanation clarifies some things that I was missing on other videos. She is very clear and has a patient, gentle and encouraging way of describing the movements and correct posture. I also like how she has segments of how to use a veil and zils, and there are a couple of dance segments, which are great. She doesn't dance or teach in cheesecake costumes, which is wonderful. My only real complaint would be I didn't care for the video effects during the dances. It was a bit too-eighties, though slight (fortunately) and I felt it didn't fully showcase her moves as well as it could have."
2,Best of the Best,This is the best I have seen and I've seen a lot.Precise instruction and dynamic routines.
2,A wonderful addition to any room,"After buying this for my husband last Christmas it has made us all VERY happy. He is NEVER without it, no matter what the season. It is always on his recliner, sometimes wrapping the granddaughter. It is exactly what he wanted. There are none sold like it around. People ask me all the time...Where did you get that? because we DO live in the HOME of the Buckeyes, yet they cannot find this."
2,"A great, romantic video!","This is a wonderful video! It has an all-star cast with Michele Lee, Melissa Gilbert, Lurene Tuttle, Christopher Lee, Jo Anne Worley, Dick Van Patten, Roddy McDowell, and Eva Gabor. It was made in the early 90's, and is a wonderful ""fairy tale romance"" for any little girl, or girl-at-heart! It has a great message of love and giving. My daughter and I watch it, and she loves it too. It has some dark moments and slightly scarry scenes, but over-all, I think it is a great family film. I wish they would re-release this on DVD!!"
2,Come on DVD!,Why do so many of these classic 1970's era Japan crossover type cartoons and puppet animation never make it to DVD?! Still one of my all time favorites after first seeing it around 20 years ago.
2,A fresh look at the gay coming-of-age process...,"From the safety of his parent's home to the intoxicating streets of Atlanta, young Justin is rapidly thrust into a world of sex and sin. The events that unfold are told from the perspective of this ""reluctant"" callboy, and it's through Justin's singular interpretation and frank observations that we are delivered a fresh narrative revolving around a common theme. But beyond the basic story we find an underlying deeper message, rare with these kinds of tales. By providing a unique and thought-provoking study in duality, Christopher Scott Sarno blurs the boundaries between right and wrong in an attempt to understand the ways in which gay men behave. He forces us to examine our choices, our needs, and the consequences of our desires. A fine first novel."
2,Sexy and Real,"Spending my ""coming out"" years in Atlanta allowed me to relate to this book from the start, hence my initial reason for purchasing it. Set in Atlanta, it is an interesting and honest account of a boy's life as a reluctant prostitute. His humble beginning, noble attempt to define himself, and his subsequent downfall are chronicled with finesse and candor. While I can see why some have labeled this book ""erotica,"" it really is more of a narrative with erotic moments. The story itself revolves around the sex but focuses more on the character's predicaments. All in all, it was a quick and enjoyable read that definitely delivered what it promised."
2,Hiiilarious,"This show is hiiiilarious! The interaction and relationship between all the characters will leave you laughing out loud. Even if you don't watch football or participate in online football leagues, you will be able to follow along and appreciate the humor of this show."
2,The First season,"I have been in a fantasy football league for 18 years, when it was not as popular as it is today. The league is very entertaining and is so true to those playing the game. I watch it in the off season for laughs.."
2,Simply the best,"(Basically the same review as I gave Season 2) While being a football fan or even someone who is in a FF League helps with the enjoyment of the show you really do not have to like either to absolutely love this show. The characters and how they interact with one another is more than enough to hook you on the show. It is well written, well acted, and simply hilarious.One thing of note though is that I enjoy Season 1 more than 2 but both are great."
2,Awesome,Even though I don't know much about football let alone fantasy football this show is great. The dynamic of the characters and the storylines never fail to entertain. Every episode is laugh out loud funny but it is certainly not for those that are easily offended! It's a real treat!
2,Thou Shalt Laugh 4,I throughly enjoyed Thou Shalt Laugh 4 - excellent comedy for the entire family. John McCormick [...].
2,Makes My Blood Run Red-White-And-Blue,"I agree that every American should read this book -- and everybody else for that matter. I don't agree that it's scholarly. Rather, it's a joy to read -- easy to understand even for a person with two master's degrees! Between McElroy's chapter on How American Culture was Formed and Ken Burns' Lewis & Clark, I don't know which makes my blood run red-white-and-bluer. And as a child of the anti-establishment `60s, it's done a lot toward helping me understand why we Americans do what we do. It's the best history book I've ever read, the best history course I've ever taken or taught. I'm buying it for my home library for my grandchildren to use as a resource. We're also using it as a resource for a book on urban planning."
